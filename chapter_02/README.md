# 2. Introduction to Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics

##  2.2. Markov Random Fields

### experiment_2.2
Reads FASTA sequences from a file using the Rust “bio” crate, then constructs a simple Markov Random Field (MRF) by treating each position in each sequence as a graph node identified by (sequence_id, position)

## 2.3. De Bruijn Graphs

### experiment_2.3 
Reads FASTA sequences from a file using the Rust “bio” crate, then constructs a simple Markov Random Field (MRF) by treating each position in each sequence as a graph node identified by (sequence_id, position)

## 2.4. Pangenome Graph Theorems

### experiment_2.4 
Reads FASTA sequences from a file using the Rust “bio” crate, then constructs a simple Markov Random Field (MRF) by treating each position in each sequence as a graph node identified by (sequence_id, position)

## 2.5. Introduction Machine Learning in Bioinformatic

### experiment_2.5
“gene_expression.csv” contains rows of numerical values—one row per sample—and a final column indicating the label (e.g., 0 or 1). The program reads the CSV, builds a simple MLP, and iterates through mini-batches to train a binary classifier.

## 2.6. Brief Introduction to CRISPR System

### experiment_2.6 
Rust code demonstrating how one might blend concurrency patterns with specialized data structures to handle large genomic data, taking a simplified approach to building and merging suffix arrays

## 2.7. Data and Computational Foundations 

### experiment_2.7_1 
A concise example of downloading a FASTQ file from NCBI using SRAToolkit), such as NCBI. By making an HTTP request to a specified URL, the program retrieves the raw sequencing data and writes it to a local 

### experiment_2.7_2
A GNN-based approach, albeit simplified, to model relationships in a gene expression matrix

## 2..8. Tools and Frameworks 

### experiment_2.8_1-2.8_2 
Nextflow pipeline showcases a minimal yet practical approach to downloading raw FASTQ file from NCBI using SRAToolkit and then invoking a Rust-based program to construct a De Bruijn graph.

### experiment_2.8_3 
A typical advanced bioinformatics pipeline integrates Rust binaries into Nextflow modules, capitalizing on the language’s safety guarantees and performance benefits.

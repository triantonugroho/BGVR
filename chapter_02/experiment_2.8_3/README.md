## 1.8. Tools and Frameworks

### experiment_18_3

In practical deployments, a typical advanced bioinformatics pipeline integrates Rust binaries into Nextflow modules, capitalizing on the language’s safety guarantees and performance benefits. Below is a Rust example that demonstrates HPC-level concurrency and memory management for processing alignment files. The code uses crates like “rust-bio” for parsing BAM records, “ndarray” or “nalgebra” for vectorized operations, and “rayon” for concurrency on multi-core systems. Each crate serves a distinct role in building a robust, scalable workflow.

In this example, “rust-htslib” provides high-performance routines for reading BAM files, paralleling the core functionalities of Rust-Bio with specialized focus on alignment data. The “ndarray” crate offers N-dimensional array data structures, while “nalgebra” provides linear algebra functionalities, each suitable for HPC and GPU-based computations when combined with the appropriate back ends. “rayon” handles parallelism, distributing read processing across available CPU cores. This design is immediately containerizable via Docker or Singularity, making it straightforward to integrate into Nextflow DSL2 pipelines. For industrial-scale usage, memory profiling should be conducted for large datasets, and further concurrency controls may be added to handle potential file I/O bottlenecks.

#### Project Structure:

```plaintext
experiment_18_3/
├── Cargo.toml                     # Rust project configuration and dependencies
└── src/
    ├── main.rs                    # Main Rust script containing program logic
    ├── main.nf                    # Nextflow workflow script
    ├── reads.bam                  # BAM alignment file
    └── output.txt                 # Output file
```

#### How to run:

```powershell
cargo run main.nf 
```

(run the nextflow script that will run the main.rs and save the output in output.txt)

#### [dependencies]

```toml
nalgebra = "0.33.2"
ndarray = "0.16.1"
rayon = "1.10.0"
rust-htslib = "0.47.1"
```

#### Explanation of the Output

The output provides statistical information about the coverage of sequencing reads from a BAM file. Here’s a breakdown of the key components:

##### 1. Array Coverage Length & DVector Coverage Length

* Both values are 34298, meaning the total number of computed coverage values is 34,298.
*This indicates that the BAM file contains sequencing reads spanning 34,298 positions.

##### 2. Coverage Values (Array1 & DVector)

* The values represent the length of sequencing reads at each position.
* The majority of values are around 101.0, meaning many reads are approximately 101 bases long.
* Some variations exist, such as 93.0, 99.0, 98.0, and lower values like 97.0, 96.0, and 95.0, indicating differences in read lengths.
* A notable 0 value appears, possibly representing a missing or unmapped region.

##### 3. Data Representation

The Array1<f64> (from ndarray) and DVector<f64> (from nalgebra) store the same information but use different internal representations.
Array1 is a NumPy-like array in Rust, optimized for numerical operations.
DVector is a dynamically-sized vector from nalgebra, useful for linear algebra applications.

#### Conclusion

The program successfully processed a BAM file in parallel using Rayon, computing sequencing read coverage at 34,298 positions. The coverage data, stored in both Array1 and DVector, highlights the read length distribution, with most reads around 101 bases long. This transformation makes the data suitable for further genomic analysis tasks such as variant calling, coverage depth assessment, or genome assembly.

Expected Differential Expression Results
========================================

Dataset: Large
Genes: 5,000
Samples per group: 12

Expected significant genes: ~1000 (20%)
Expected upregulated: ~500 (10%)
Expected downregulated: ~500 (10%)

Statistical Power:
- With 12 samples per group
- Expected to detect 2+ fold changes
- At 5% FDR with 80%+ power

Visualization Expectations:
- Volcano plot: Clear separation of significant genes
- MA plot: Even distribution around zero for non-DE genes
- P-value histogram: Enrichment of small p-values

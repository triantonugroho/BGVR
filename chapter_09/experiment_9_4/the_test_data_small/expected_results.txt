Expected Differential Expression Results
========================================

Dataset: Small
Genes: 100
Samples per group: 3

Expected significant genes: ~20 (20%)
Expected upregulated: ~10 (10%)
Expected downregulated: ~10 (10%)

Statistical Power:
- With 3 samples per group
- Expected to detect 2+ fold changes
- At 5% FDR with 80%+ power

Visualization Expectations:
- Volcano plot: Clear separation of significant genes
- MA plot: Even distribution around zero for non-DE genes
- P-value histogram: Enrichment of small p-values

## 9.1 Foundations of Gene Expression Analysis

### experiment_9_1

In production environments, managing large-scale RNA-seq data processing pipelines demands efficient and reliable tooling. Rust has gained significant traction in bioinformatics for its performance characteristics, memory safety guarantees, and zero-cost abstractions. Many computational biologists leverage Nextflow for orchestrating complex multi-step workflows while utilizing Rust for the computationally intensive components. Below is a comprehensive Rust program demonstrating an industrial-strength pipeline for parsing multiple transcript count files, applying various normalization methods (TMM, CPM, standard, DESeq2-style median-of-ratios, and upper quartile), and generating detailed analysis reports. This implementation incorporates production-ready features including robust error handling with custom error types, parallel processing using Rayon, a comprehensive CLI interface with clap, progress tracking with indicatif, structured logging, and multiple statistical approaches for gene expression normalization with configurable filtering thresholds.

The rust implementation demonstrates a production-ready RNA-seq analysis tool that efficiently handles large datasets through several key architectural decisions. The use of Rayon enables parallel processing of gene filtering and file loading operations, significantly reducing processing time for large sample sets. Custom error types with thiserror provide clear error propagation and debugging capabilities essential for production environments. The implementation includes comprehensive input validation, graceful handling of malformed count files, and flexible filtering parameters that allow researchers to customize analysis parameters based on their experimental designs.

For industrial-scale deployments, this codebase can be extended with additional features such as: integration with cloud storage systems (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) through async I/O with tokio, streaming data processing for extremely large files that exceed memory capacity, integration with distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark through datafusion, comprehensive logging and monitoring with structured logging frameworks, and containerization with Docker for reproducible deployments. The modular design allows easy extension with additional normalization methods, output formats (HDF5, Parquet), and integration with downstream analysis tools. Production environments often enhance this foundation with automated testing suites, continuous integration pipelines, and performance benchmarking to ensure scalability across diverse computational infrastructures

Nextflow complements this Rust core by providing sophisticated workflow orchestration, containerization strategies, and dynamic parallel scheduling across diverse computational infrastructures. The integration enables seamless coordination of complex multi-step RNA-seq analyses while maintaining reproducibility and scalability. Below is a comprehensive Nextflow pipeline that orchestrates the complete RNA-seq workflow: quality control with FastQC, genome indexing and read alignment with STAR, gene quantification with HTSeq, count normalization using the custom Rust analyzer, and quality reporting with MultiQC. This production-ready implementation demonstrates advanced features including conditional workflow branching, test mode capabilities for development, dynamic resource allocation, comprehensive error handling, and automated generation of both technical summaries and publication-ready reports. The pipeline illustrates how containerization ensures reproducible environments across different computational platforms while the flexible parameter system accommodates diverse experimental designs and institutional requirements.

In practice, this Nextflow pipeline architecture demonstrates best practices for production-ready bioinformatics workflows that can scale from individual research projects to enterprise-level pharmaceutical studies. The implementation showcases several critical production features: the conditional workflow branching allows for rapid development and testing using existing count files while maintaining the full analytical pipeline for production runs; the sophisticated error handling ensures graceful degradation when optional tools are unavailable; and the comprehensive reporting system generates both machine-readable JSON summaries and human-readable HTML reports suitable for regulatory documentation.

Production deployments typically extend this foundation with additional enterprise features such as: integration with workflow management systems like Tower for centralized monitoring and execution tracking; automated resource scaling based on sample count and computational load; integration with laboratory information management systems (LIMS) for seamless sample tracking; comprehensive audit logging for regulatory compliance in pharmaceutical environments; and dynamic container selection based on computational requirements and available infrastructure.

In pharmaceutical and biotechnology settings, teams frequently report significant improvements in both processing time and result reproducibility when transitioning from ad-hoc analysis scripts to these integrated Rust-Nextflow architectures. Success stories often highlight scenarios where the robust normalization algorithms and statistical rigor enabled detection of subtle but clinically significant gene expression signatures that were missed by previous analysis approaches. By combining Rust's computational efficiency with Nextflow's orchestration capabilities, these pipelines serve as critical infrastructure for precision medicine initiatives, enabling the processing of thousands of samples while maintaining the statistical rigor and reproducibility requirements essential for translating research findings into clinical applications. The synergy between high-performance computing, statistical robustness, and workflow orchestration positions these pipelines as foundational components in next-generation drug discovery and companion diagnostic development programs.

#### Explanation of the Output

##### ✨ What Happens in the Code (main.rs)?

Overall:
This Rust program reads a VCF file, parses each variant, calculates a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value for each position using a chi-square test, then saves the results to a CSV file.

##### 🔍 Step-by-Step Explanation:
###### 1. Libraries:
* statrs: To do chi-square test and compute p-value.
* polars: To create a DataFrame (like a table) and easily save it as a CSV.
* rust-htslib is mentioned but not actually used (this is manual parsing).

###### 2. Key Functions:
###### (A) chi_square_hw(aa, ab, bb, p)
* Inputs:
  * aa = count of homozygous reference (0/0) samples
  * ab = count of heterozygous (0/1 or 1/0) samples
  * bb = count of homozygous alternate (1/1) samples
  * p = allele frequency (reference allele)
* Calculates expected counts under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
* Calculates a chi-square statistic.
* Converts chi-square statistic to a p-value.
  * A high p-value (near 1) = good fit to HW equilibrium.
  * A low p-value (near 0) = deviation from HW.

###### (B) process_vcf_file(vcf_path, start_pos, end_pos)
* Opens the VCF file line-by-line.
* Skips meta-information lines (##...).
* Parses the #CHROM header to detect sample columns.
* For each variant line:
  * Filters variants based on position (start_pos to end_pos).
  * Extracts genotypes from samples.
  * Counts 0/0, 0/1, 1/1 occurrences.
  * Calculates allele frequency p.
  * Calculates Hardy-Weinberg p-value.
  * Stores info in a list.
* Creates a DataFrame from the list.
* Returns the DataFrame.

###### (C) main()
* Reads command line arguments:
  * VCF path
  * Start and End positions (optional)
* Calls process_vcf_file.
* Prints the DataFrame to terminal.
* Saves the DataFrame to a .csv file (same name as VCF + .hw_results.csv).

##### 📂 Your Input Dataset: synthetic.vcf

```text
##fileformat=VCFv4.2
##contig=<ID=1,length=249250621>
#CHROM  POS     ID      REF     ALT     QUAL    FILTER  INFO    FORMAT  Sample1 Sample2 Sample3
1       12345   .       A       G       50.0    PASS    NS=3    GT      0/0     0/1     1/1
1       67890   .       T       C       40.0    PASS    NS=3    GT      0/1     1/1     0/0
```

Two variants (positions 12345 and 67890) across 3 samples (Sample1, Sample2, Sample3).

##### 🧪 Calculation Details per Variant

###### Variant 1:
* Position: 12345
* Genotypes: 0/0, 0/1, 1/1
* Counts:
  * 0/0 → 1 sample
  * 0/1 → 1 sample
  * 1/1 → 1 sample

* Allele Frequency (p):

### Allele Frequency (p)

$$
p = \frac{(2 \times \text{count}(AA) + \text{count}(AB))}{2 \times \text{total samples}}
$$

Substituting values:

$$
p = \frac{(2 \times 1) + 1}{2 \times 3} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5
$$

---

### Expected Genotype Counts

- Homozygous Reference (AA, `0/0`):

$$
\text{Expected}(AA) = p^2 \times 3 = (0.5)^2 \times 3 = 0.75
$$

- Heterozygous (AB, `0/1` or `1/0`):

$$
\text{Expected}(AB) = 2 \times p \times (1 - p) \times 3 = 2 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 3 = 1.5
$$

- Homozygous Alternate (BB, `1/1`):

$$
\text{Expected}(BB) = (1 - p)^2 \times 3 = (0.5)^2 \times 3 = 0.75
$$

---

### Chi-Square Statistic

Chi-Square formula:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(\text{Observed} - \text{Expected})^2}{\text{Expected}}
$$

Substituting values:

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(1 - 0.75)^2}{0.75} + \frac{(1 - 1.5)^2}{1.5} + \frac{(1 - 0.75)^2}{0.75}
$$

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{0.0625}{0.75} + \frac{0.25}{1.5} + \frac{0.0625}{0.75}
$$

$$
\chi^2 = 0.0833 + 0.1667 + 0.0833 = 0.3333
$$

---

### P-Value Calculation

Using the Chi-Square distribution with 1 degree of freedom:

$$
p\text{-value} = 1 - \text{CDF}(\chi^2, df=1)
$$

Substituting the value:

$$
p\text{-value} = 1 - \text{CDF}(0.3333, 1) \approx 0.5637
$$

---

### Final Interpretation

- If \( p\text{-value} > 0.05 \), there is **no significant deviation** from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE).
- In this case:

$$
p\text{-value} = 0.5637 > 0.05
$$

✅ **Conclusion**: This variant **is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium**.



##### 📝 Output CSV: synthetic.vcf.hw_results.csv

| Chromosome | Position | Reference Allele | Alternate Allele | HWE p-value |
|:----------:|:--------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-----------:|
| 1          | 12345    | A                | G                | 0.5637      |
| 1          | 67890    | T                | C                | 0.5637      |

##### 🛠 Executable: vcf_analysis

* Compiled main.rs into a binary.
* Can be called as:

```text
./vcf_analysis synthetic.vcf
```

It will generate and print the CSV automatically.

#### ✅ Conclusion
* Purpose: This program checks if genetic variants are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

* Result interpretation:

* Both variants have high p-values (~0.56) → No significant deviation from HW equilibrium.

* Why useful?

  * Hardy-Weinberg deviations may indicate genotyping errors, population stratification, selection, etc.

In your case, the dataset is tiny and idealized, so the p-values are expectedly moderate.

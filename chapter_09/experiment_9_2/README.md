## 9.2 Data Acquisition and Transcript Quantification

### experiment_9_2

In real-world RNA-seq pipelines, code needs to ingest raw sequencing reads, perform pseudo-alignment against a k-mer index, and generate transcript quantification results suitable for downstream analysis. Below is a production-ready Rust implementation demonstrating a complete pseudo-alignment workflow that processes FASTQ files against pre-built k-mer indices. The implementation leverages modern Rust crates including rayon for parallel processing, serde for JSON serialization of k-mer indices, dashmap for thread-safe data structures, and indicatif for progress tracking during large-scale data processing.

This implementation demonstrates a complete pseudo-alignment quantification pipeline that processes sequencing reads by matching k-mers against transcript indices and computing TPM (Transcripts Per Million) values. The production-ready code includes sophisticated error handling through custom error types, multi-threaded FASTQ parsing with support for gzipped files, and comprehensive logging with progress bars for monitoring system performance. The rayon crate enables efficient parallel iteration over read collections, while dashmap provides thread-safe concurrent access to transcript count data. The serde ecosystem facilitates robust k-mer index loading from JSON format, and the quantification algorithm implements proper normalization accounting for transcript effective lengths, making it suitable for comparative expression analysis in genomics workflows.

Nextflow can be employed to orchestrate pseudo-alignment workflows alongside other bioinformatics tasks like quality control and software version tracking. The following pipeline script demonstrates how a Rust-based pseudo-alignment tool can be integrated into a production workflow, with dynamic tool discovery, automated building, and comprehensive logging.

This pipeline exemplifies how Nextflow dynamically handles tool deployment and execution, automatically building the Rust pseudo-alignment binary if needed and providing robust error handling throughout the process. In production environments, such workflows typically integrate containerized execution to ensure reproducibility across different computational backends, from local clusters to cloud infrastructure. The pipeline's structured logging, version tracking, and automated report generation through MultiQC integration are essential for maintaining audit trails and troubleshooting in enterprise bioinformatics environments.

In practice, computational biologists configure these pipelines to process large RNA-seq cohorts efficiently, enabling downstream machine learning workflows that correlate transcript expression patterns with clinical outcomes. Recent deployments of similar Rust-based pseudo-alignment pipelines have demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional alignment approaches, with processing times reduced by an order of magnitude while maintaining quantification accuracy. Such efficiency gains prove critical in time-sensitive research contexts, particularly in precision medicine applications where rapid turnaround from sequencing to actionable insights can impact patient care decisions.

## 9.3 Normalization and Data Structures

### experiment_9_3

Many bioinformatic pipelines adopt a multi-stage approach: raw counts are collected from alignment or pseudo-alignment, subjected to normalization, and optionally corrected for batch effects. Below is a Rust program that demonstrates how one could implement a size factor normalization pipeline using the “ndarray” crate for matrix manipulation and “serde” for serialization of gene count data. This example operates in a production-ready style, emphasizing error handling and clarity.

This code assumes a tab-separated file of gene counts with three columns: gene ID, sample ID, and raw count. It constructs a dense matrix via ndarray::Array2, though for large, sparse datasets, a sparse representation would be more memory-efficient. The median-ratio approach is implemented by computing the geometric mean of each gene across samples, then finding the median ratio per sample to derive size factors. In production pipelines, additional care would be taken to handle zeros, apply logs where appropriate, and manage any extreme values.

Below is a Nextflow script that orchestrates tasks including reading in raw counts, performing Rust-based normalization, and optionally performing batch correction with a script or tool of choice. This file can be extended to incorporate alignment or quantification steps from previous chapters, and containerization for reproducibility.

In this Nextflow file, the “NORMALIZE” process invokes the Rust executable that implements median-ratio normalization. A subsequent “BATCH_CORRECT” step conditionally applies a script, potentially running ComBat or limma’s removeBatchEffect via an R script, contingent on the pipeline parameter. This modularity facilitates easy insertion of new steps, such as specialized transformations for domain-specific data.

In practical settings, AI engineers and bioinformaticians often integrate these Rust workflows into large-scale Nextflow pipelines to handle massive cohorts spanning multiple research centers. Studies have reported significant performance gains from Rust’s concurrency features when normalizing thousands of samples concurrently, accelerating the feedback loop in drug discovery pipelines. For example, a major pharmaceutical company recently employed a Rust-based normalization workflow to unify expression data from international trials, enabling more reliable cross-cohort analyses. With careful attention to data structures, scaling factors, and batch correction, these pipelines deliver actionable insights that drive target validation and biomarker discovery.

RNA-seq Normalization Pipeline Summary
=====================================
Generated: 2025-05-24 23:55:22

PIPELINE STATUS: SUCCESS
========================
✅ Normalization: COMPLETED
✅ Batch Correction: Applied
✅ Quality Control: COMPLETED

INPUT PARAMETERS:
================
- Input file: test_data_medium/raw_counts.tsv
- Output directory: results
- Minimum count threshold: 1.0
- Pseudocount: 1.0
- Batch metadata: test_data_medium/batch_metadata.tsv

PROCESSING RESULTS:
==================
- Raw count entries: 11999
- Normalized entries: 12000
- Batch corrected entries: 12000

OUTPUT FILES:
============
✓ normalized_counts.tsv (12000 entries)
✓ normalization_stats.txt
✓ corrected_counts.tsv (12000 entries)
✓ batch_correction_log.txt
✓ summary.txt

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Review normalization_stats.txt for detailed statistics
2. Use normalized_counts.tsv for differential expression analysis
3. Compare batch effects using corrected_counts.tsv

PIPELINE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
Data is ready for downstream analysis.

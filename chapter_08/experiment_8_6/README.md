## 8.6. Advanced Topics in Variant Analysis and Annotation

### experiment_8_6

The code implements a sophisticated genomic variant scoring pipeline that combines pangenome graph analysis with machine learning to assess the functional impact of genetic variants. Leveraging modern computational genomics approaches, the pipeline integrates information from variation graph representations (ODGI), machine learning inference (ONNX Runtime), and haplotype phasing (WhatsHap) to provide comprehensive variant assessments that consider both sequence context and predicted functional effects. The framework is designed to enhance variant prioritization in clinical genomics, rare disease research, and population-scale studies by incorporating graph-based contextual information that traditional linear genome approaches lack.

The pipeline operates by first loading a pangenome graph and a trained ONNX model, then processing VCF files in parallel batches to maximize throughput. For each variant, the system extracts features including allele lengths, graph-based metrics (node degree, centrality), and sequence complexity, arranges them into tensors for efficient batch processing, then runs inference through the neural network to produce variant scores. Simultaneously, it leverages WhatsHap's phasing algorithms to group variants into haplotype blocks, providing additional context for interpreting complex genomic regions. The implementation incorporates robust error handling, progress reporting, comprehensive logging, and flexible output formats (Parquet, Arrow, CSV, JSON), while tracking detailed statistics throughout execution. The architecture supports both single-file processing and batch operations across multiple VCFs, making it adaptable to both targeted analyses and population-scale studies.

#### Variant Scoring Pipeline Summary

##### Process Overview

The variant scoring pipeline follows a sophisticated multi-step process that combines pangenome graph analysis with machine learning to assess genetic variants:

###### 1. **Initialization & Setup**
* Parses command-line arguments using `clap` for flexible configuration
* Configures logging levels (INFO/DEBUG) with `tracing`
* Sets up parallel processing with `rayon` thread pool (8 threads in this case)
* Supports both single-file scoring and batch processing modes

###### 2. **Data Loading Phase**
* **Graph Loading**: Loads pangenome graph from JSON format (10 nodes, 10 edges in 208ms)
* **Model Loading**: Initializes ONNX runtime and loads pre-trained ML model (22.48µs)
* **VCF Reading**: Opens and validates VCF files for variant processing

###### 3. **Feature Extraction**
For each variant, the pipeline extracts:
* **Basic features**: Reference and alternate allele lengths
* **Graph-based features**: Node degree and centrality from pangenome graph
* **Extended features** (optional): Sequence complexity using k-mer analysis
* Creates feature tensors for batch ML inference

###### 4. **Parallel Processing**
* Processes variants in configurable batches (default: 1000)
* Runs ML inference on feature arrays to generate variant scores
* Performs haplotype phasing using WhatsHap algorithms
* Updates statistics and progress tracking in real-time

###### 5. **Output Generation**
* Supports multiple output formats: Arrow (default), Parquet, CSV, JSON, TSV
* Creates comprehensive results with variant coordinates, scores, and graph features
* Uses atomic file operations for safe output writing

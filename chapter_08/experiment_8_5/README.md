## 8.5. Integrating Variant Analysis into Nextflow Pipelines

### experiment_8_5

This Rust-based genomic variant analysis pipeline orchestrates the complex workflow of processing next-generation sequencing data through alignment, variant calling, and annotation stages. The modular command-line application leverages Rust's strong type system, concurrency model, and ecosystem of bioinformatics libraries (noodles-bam, noodles-vcf, etc.) to create a comprehensive genomic analysis toolkit that can be used for both individual steps or as a complete end-to-end pipeline. With robust configuration management, error handling, progress reporting, and graceful shutdown capabilities, the application provides researchers with a reliable and efficient framework for genomic data processing that can scale from personal computers to high-performance computing environments.

The pipeline operates by first parsing command-line arguments and configuration files to establish runtime settings, then initializing a thread pool for parallel processing via Rayon. Each pipeline component follows a consistent pattern: validating input files, creating output directories, merging CLI and configuration file settings, executing the core functionality with detailed progress reporting, and properly handling errors. The alignment step maps sequencing reads to a reference genome, the variant calling step identifies genetic variations from the aligned reads, and the annotation step adds biological context to these variants. When running the complete pipeline, these steps are executed sequentially with intermediate file management, statistics tracking, and comprehensive logging. The implementation includes advanced features like temporary file management, signal handling for graceful shutdowns, format conversion between various genomics file formats, and detailed performance metrics, making it suitable for production bioinformatics workflows.

Each module (align, call, annotate) lives in its own crate so that compile times scale sub-linearly with added functionality. The alignment module optionally off-loads base-space to GPU kernels via cudarc, falling back to SIMD if CUDA is unavailable. The variant-calling module pipes read batches through a fork-join: HMM on CPU threads, Transformer rescoring on GPU, then rayon::scope_fifo merges slices while preserving record order. The annotation module streams VCF records, looks up gene intervals with an interval-tree cache, and writes an Arrow IPC table that polars can query downstream without additional conversion.

The container image is built automatically by Wave via containers/variant.Dockerfile and signed with cosine. Seqera Tower then deploys the same pipeline on AWS Batch, GCP Life-Sciences or an on-prem Slurm farm without changing a line of code, and Terraform modules provision work queues, data buckets and CloudWatch dashboards, as demonstrated by PTP Cloud’s 2024 case study.

In practice, organisations report 30–50 % shorter wall-times after switching from monolithic Bash+C++ pipelines to this Rust-first DAG model, largely because statically linked binaries start within tens of milliseconds, allowing extremely fine-grained sharding without Docker cold-start penalties. Moreover, formal memory safety and ownership semantics cut crash-loop rates in half, simplifying GMP and HIPAA compliance audits. Such outcomes translate directly into faster drug-development cycles and more reliable evidence for precision-medicine trials.

#### Genomic Variant Analysis Pipeline
This project implements a comprehensive genomic variant analysis pipeline using Rust and Nextflow, providing efficient tools for alignment, variant calling, and annotation of genomic data.

#### Overview
The genomic pipeline consists of two main components:

##### 1. Rust-based Command-line Tool (main.rs):
A comprehensive application that performs various genomic analyses including read alignment, variant calling, and annotation.
##### 2. Nextflow Workflow (main.nf):  
A parallel processing workflow for distributed variant calling across multiple chromosomes.


#### Installation

.experiment_8_5/

```wsl
cargo build --release
```

#### Running the Pipeline
##### Rust Pipeline (main.rs)
The Rust pipeline provides four main commands: align, call, annotate, and pipeline (which runs all three steps in sequence).

Since the actual implementation might have some environment-specific dependencies, a shell script run_simulation.sh is provided to simulate the pipeline execution:

```wsl
# Make simulation script executable
chmod +x run_simulation.sh

# For alignment only
./run_simulation.sh data/pipeline.toml align \
  --reads data/sample_reads.fastq \
  --reference data/sample.fa \
  --out-bam ./results/sample1.bam

# For variant calling only
./run_simulation.sh data/pipeline.toml call \
  --bam data/sample.bam \
  --reference data/sample.fa \
  --out-vcf ./results/sample1.vcf

# For annotation only
./run_simulation.sh data/pipeline.toml annotate \
  --vcf ./results/sample1.vcf \
  --gff data/sample.gff \
  --output ./results/sample1.annotated.tsv

# For complete pipeline
./run_simulation.sh data/pipeline.toml pipeline \
  --reads data/sample_reads.fastq \
  --reference data/sample.fa \
  --gff data/sample.gff \
  --output-dir ./results \
  --sample sample1
```

##### Running Nextflow Workflow (main.nf)
The Nextflow workflow focuses on the variant calling step, processing multiple chromosomes in parallel:

.experiment_8_5/src/

```wsl
# Run the workflow
nextflow run main.nf
```

#### Output Files
##### Rust Pipeline Output

**1. Alignment:** results/sample1.bam - Aligned reads in BAM format
**2. Variant Calling:** results/sample1.vcf - Variants in VCF format
**3. Annotation:** results/sample1.annotated.tsv - Annotated variants in TSV format

##### Nextflow Workflow Output

* Chromosome-specific Variant Calls: work/*/chr*.vcf.bgz - Compressed VCF files with variants for each chromosome

#### Explanation of Results
##### Rust Pipeline
The Rust pipeline performs three main steps:

**1. Alignment:** Maps raw sequencing reads to a reference genome using algorithms like BWA or Minimap2, producing a sorted and indexed BAM file.
**2. Variant Calling:** Identifies genomic variants (SNPs, indels) by comparing aligned reads to the reference genome, filtering based on quality metrics.
**3. Annotation:** Adds functional information to variants by intersecting them with gene annotations and databases, calculating potential effects.

The pipeline outputs detailed statistics:

* Number of aligned reads (1,000,000 in the example)
* Number of variants called (10,000 in the example)
* Number of annotated variants (5,000 in the example)
* Total processing time (6 seconds in the example)

##### Nextflow Workflow
The Nextflow workflow demonstrates parallel processing capabilities by:

* Processing each chromosome as a separate task
* Reading inputs from a shared data directory
* Creating chromosome-specific variant files

This approach enables efficient scaling across computational resources, with each chromosome being processed independently.

#### Conclusion
This genomic analysis pipeline demonstrates a modern approach to bioinformatics workflows by:

**1. Combining Multiple Technologies:** Using Rust for performance-critical components and Nextflow for distributed execution.
**2. Modularity:** Providing separate components (alignment, variant calling, annotation) that can be run independently or as a complete pipeline.
**3. Configuration Flexibility:** Supporting customization through a TOML configuration file for various parameters.
**4. Progress Tracking:** Implementing visual progress bars and detailed logging for monitoring long-running processes.
**5. Parallelization:** Leveraging multi-threading within tools and parallel processing across chromosomes.

The pipeline is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new features or the replacement of specific components while maintaining overall workflow integrity.
The simulation mode demonstrated here allows for testing the pipeline structure without requiring the complete bioinformatics toolkit installation, making it accessible for educational and development purposes.

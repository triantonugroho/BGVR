## 8.4. Variant-annotation Principles

### experiment_8_4

The code below presents a robust genomic variant annotation pipeline that integrates multiple data sources to predict the pathogenicity of genetic variants. This tool processes VCF files containing genetic variants and enriches them with critical annotations including gene context from GFF files, population allele frequencies from gnomAD, and potential splicing effects predicted by a neural network model. The comprehensive framework applies a logistic function to combine these annotations into a pathogenicity score, enabling researchers to prioritize variants for further investigation in disease studies, clinical diagnostics, or variant interpretation workflows.

This pipeline functions through a sophisticated multi-step process that begins by building chromosome-specific gene interval trees from GFF data and loading population frequency data into an efficient hash map. For each variant in the input VCF, the tool performs parallel annotation using Rayon, identifying overlapping genes, retrieving allele frequencies, and when a reference genome and model are provided, predicting splicing effects by extracting sequence context and performing neural network inference with PyTorch. The implementation incorporates thorough error handling with custom error types, caches sequences to minimize redundant lookups, provides detailed progress reporting with indicatif, implements flexible output formats (Parquet, CSV, JSON), and includes comprehensive logging. Key improvements in the revised version include robust input validation, efficient parallel processing, memory management through caching, detailed statistics tracking, and configurable filtering options that make the tool suitable for high-throughput genomic analysis pipelines.

#### Explanation of Variant Annotator Output

##### Command Execution
The command successfully executed the variant-annotator tool with the following inputs:

* VCF file: sample.vcf
* GFF file: sample.gff
* Frequency data: sample.freq.tsv.gz
* Reference genome: ref.fa

The tool ran with 4 threads, verbose logging, and a context size of 5001 bases.

##### Processing Steps

###### 1. Gene Interval Tree Construction:

* Successfully built gene trees from the GFF file
* Processed 1 record and identified 1 gene on a single chromosome
* This step took 12.01ms

###### 2. Frequency Data Loading:

* Loaded allele frequency data from the compressed TSV file
* Retrieved 2 frequency entries from 3 lines in the file
* This operation took 6.65ms

###### 3. Variant Processing:

* Processed and annotated 2 variants from the VCF file
* All variants were located on chromosome 1


###### 4. Output Generation:

* Successfully saved annotations to annotated.parquet
* The entire annotation process completed in 438.67ms

##### Results Preview
The output shows a preview of the annotated variants:
| CHROM | POS  | REF | ALT | GENE  | AF     | ΔPSI  | PATH SCORE |
|-------|------|-----|-----|-------|--------|-------|------------|
| chr1  | 1000 | A   | C   | GENE1 | 0.005  | 0.000 | 0.500      |
| chr1  | 2000 | G   | T   |       | 0.0005 | 0.000 | 0.731      |

#### Conclusion
The variant-annotator tool successfully:

* Integrated information from multiple genomic data sources (VCF, GFF, frequency data)
* Performed functional annotation of genetic variants
* Applied a simple pathogenicity scoring model based on allele frequency
* Generated a structured Parquet file for downstream analysis

The output shows that the tool is working as expected, efficiently processing the input data and generating informative annotations. The disabled PyTorch functionality (for splice effect prediction) did not affect the tool's ability to provide basic annotations, though it would provide additional information if enabled.
The low processing time (438.67ms) demonstrates the efficiency of the implementation, even though the test dataset was small (2 variants). The Rust implementation with parallel processing capability would likely scale well to larger datasets.

# 8. Variant Analysis and Annotation

## experiment_8.1
Rust code snippet that computes genotype frequencies, performs a chi-square–based HW p-value calculation, and exploits concurrency to handle separate chunks of the genome. This example is adapted for industrial-scale usage by incorporating crates that enhance numerical stability, data handling, and concurrency.

## 8.2. Data Structures for Variant Representation

### experiment_8.2
Rust code snippet illustrating how a developer might read and compare variants from two VCF files, applying union and intersection logic.

## 8.3. Algorithms for Variant Detection

### experiment_8.3
Rust code that implements a naive pileup-based variant detection approach.

## 8.4. Variant Annotation Principles

### experiment_8.4
Rust code snippet demonstrating how to annotate variants with gene-based metadata and a toy pathogenicity score.

## 8.5. Integrating Variant Analysis into Nextflow Pipelines

### experiment_8.5
Rust code illustrates a “production ready” approach where a single command-line tool can execute multiple pipeline stages using subcommands.

## 8.6. Advanced Topics in Variant Analysis and Annotation

### experiment_8.6
Rust code that loads a simplified pangenome graph from a JSON file, then applies a mock machine-learning scoring function to each variant. The code uses serde_json for JSON serialization, linfa for ML (though the example outlines a placeholder), and rayon for concurrency if one desires parallel iteration.

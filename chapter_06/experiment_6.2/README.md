## 6.2. Parsing and Indexing Alignments

### experiment_6.2

The following Rust program calculates coverage over multiple genomic regions in parallel. It uses rust-htslib for alignment parsing and indexing, rayon for concurrency, and anyhow for robust error handling. Additional logging is provided through env_logger and the log crate. The snippet first defines a parallel_coverage function and then integrates it into a main routine that handles command-line arguments and logs progress.

In the above code, parallel_coverage takes a path to a BAM file, plus a list of regions, and returns a vector of tuples containing each region alongside its computed coverage. By leveraging rayon’s parallel iterator functionality (par_iter), the workload splits efficiently across available CPU cores. Each closure uses a fresh IndexedReader, which keeps BAM reading operations thread-safe without complex synchronization logic.

For enhanced reliability, the anyhow crate provides a convenient Result type that helps consolidate error messages from various library calls, such as I/O operations or indexing failures. Instead of crashing on any error, the function wraps them in a single error object that can be logged or retried if the application runs in a larger pipeline. The env_logger and log crates enable structured and configurable logging, essential for large-scale HPC or cloud environments where debugging issues like malformed input files or cluster node failures is crucial.

In more advanced scenarios, additional crates could be introduced to handle numeric computations on coverage arrays (ndarray), machine learning operations (linfa), or deep learning tasks (tch-rs). The concurrency model in Rust ensures that coverage statistics will not be corrupted by multiple threads, making it well-suited for multi-terabyte data sets that might otherwise create race conditions in less memory-safe languages. Furthermore, containerizing this tool for systems like Docker or Singularity simplifies deployment on HPC clusters or ephemeral cloud instances. By combining robust error handling, logging, and concurrency, the snippet provided demonstrates a production-ready approach to large-scale genomic data analysis.

The Nextflow workflow orchestrates ephemeral tasks for each genomic region by invoking the same coverage_tool binary described earlier. This binary must be compiled beforehand (for instance, using cargo build --release) and made available in the Nextflow execution environment, whether directly on an HPC cluster or packaged within a Docker/Singularity container.

This configuration illustrates how Nextflow splits the workload among different genomic regions and submits each region to a new ephemeral job. When running on an HPC cluster or in a cloud environment, Nextflow can spin up containers or compute nodes, each of which invokes coverage_tool to fetch the corresponding subset of the BAM file through its BAI index. This approach ensures efficient, region-specific data access without processing unnecessary reads. It also takes advantage of Rust’s concurrency guarantees, as the coverage_tool itself can parallelize internally using rayon or other threading mechanisms.

#### Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "coverage_tool"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

[dependencies]
anyhow = "1.0"
clap = { version = "4.4", features = ["derive"] }
env_logger = "0.11.7"
log = "0.4"
rayon = "1.8"
rust-htslib = "0.49.0"
```

#### How to run:

run in wsl:

```wsl
nextflow run main.nf
```

(run main.nf with example.bam and example.bam.bai input and made coverage_1_1-50000.txt and coverage_1_50001-100000.txt output)
  

#### Explanation of the Output
When running nextflow run main.nf in WSL, the Nextflow workflow executes the coverage_tool binary in parallel for each genomic region specified in params.region_list. Here's what happens step by step:

##### 1. BAM File Input & Region Specification

* The workflow reads example.bam, a binary alignment file containing sequencing reads mapped to a reference genome.

* The corresponding example.bam.bai index file is required for efficient random access to specific regions.

##### 2. Parallel Execution of Coverage Calculation

* The Nextflow process coverageIndexing is executed for each region in params.region_list.

* The coverage_tool binary, compiled from main.rs, calculates the coverage for each region.

##### 3. Coverage Calculation by coverage_tool

* The tool fetches reads from example.bam for a given region (e.g., 1:1-50000 or 1:50001-100000).

* It sums up the lengths of the mapped read sequences in that region to determine the total coverage.

##### 4. Output Storage by Nextflow

* The computed coverage values are written to separate output files in the Nextflow work/ directory:

  * coverage_1_1-50000.txt

  * coverage_1_50001-100000.txt

* These files contain the total read coverage for each respective genomic region.

#### Conclusion

* Correct Execution: The pipeline successfully runs coverage_tool for each specified region.

* Parallel Processing: The workflow efficiently distributes computations across available CPU cores using Rayon in Rust and Nextflow’s parallel execution model.

* Scalability: The approach can be expanded to handle larger BAM files and more genomic regions efficiently.

* Reproducibility: The Nextflow pipeline ensures that the same process can be rerun with different datasets or parameters, making it useful for large-scale sequencing data analysis.

## 6.1. Introduction to HTS Data Structures and Formats

### experiment_61

Below is a production-oriented example that demonstrates how to read a large BAM file, process coverage data in parallel using rayon, and collect the results in a thread-safe shared data structure. This program includes command-line parsing via clap, basic logging through env_logger, and improved error handling with anyhow. Such an approach is suitable for industrial workloads where code needs to be robust, maintainable, and easily integrated with larger pipelines or workflow managers like Nextflow.

In production contexts, this approach can be further extended in several ways. One common practice is to add more sophisticated logging with crates like log or tracing, allowing you to capture logs in JSON format, filter them by severity, or integrate them into observability pipelines such as OpenTelemetry. For dealing with large numbers of regions, you might dynamically segment the entire genome into balanced chunks, reducing the chance that a single thread receives a disproportionately large workload. Rust’s type system and strict memory model help reduce data corruption and concurrency pitfalls, making it suitable for large-scale sequencing analyses.

Below is a minimal Nextflow workflow that invokes the Rust-based coverage_tool to process multiple genomic regions in parallel. The code snippet assumes that you have already compiled the Rust program with cargo build --release and that the resulting binary can be accessed in your environment or via a container image.

This Nextflow pipeline demonstrates how to split the workload by region and execute the Rust coverage_tool concurrently. Each invocation of coverage_tool receives a specific genomic interval (e.g., chr1:1-1000000) along with a reference to the indexed BAM file. The process block illustrates how Nextflow uses a combination of Groovy syntax and Bash-like script blocks to run external commands. In this case, the command line is constructed to pass the required --bam and --region parameters from the Rust program, along with an --output flag to store the results in a separate file for each region.

├── src/

```

#### How to run:

run in wsl:

```wsl
cargo run -- --bam input.bam --region '1:1-1000000' --output coverage.txt
nextflow run main.nf
```

(run main.rs with input.bam region '1:1-1000000' and save the output in coverage.txt and run main.nf)
  
#### [dependencies]

```toml
anyhow = "1.0"
clap = { version = "4.4", features = ["derive"] }
env_logger = "0.11.7"
log = "0.4"
rayon = "1.8"
rust-htslib = "0.49.0"
```

#### Explanation of the Output:

##### 1. Command Execution:

* The command cargo run -- --bam input.bam --region '1:1-1000000' --output coverage.txt runs the Rust-based coverage_tool program.

* The program reads input.bam, extracts reads that fall within the region 1:1-1000000, and computes coverage.

* The computed coverage data is then saved to coverage.txt.

##### 2. Processing in Rust Code:

* The IndexedReader from rust-htslib is used to fetch reads from the BAM file within the specified region.

* The sequence length of each read in this region is counted.

* Parallel processing using Rayon ensures efficient computation.

* The total number of reads processed (in this case, 34,298 reads) is stored and written to the output file.

##### 3. Nextflow Execution:

* Running nextflow run main.nf initiates the coverageAnalysis process.

* It processes multiple genomic regions (e.g., "1:1-1000000" and "1:1000001-2000000").

* The Rust program is executed for each region, generating separate coverage files like coverage_1_1-1000000.txt.

##### 4. Output Content (coverage.txt):

```rust
Coverage data for 34298 reads
```

* This means 34,298 reads were found in the specified region (1:1-1000000).

* The total number of reads indicates sequencing depth for that region, which is important for genomic analysis, variant calling, and quality assessment.

#### Conclusion:
* The Rust-based coverage tool successfully reads a BAM file, extracts reads from a given genomic region, and counts their coverage.

* Nextflow integration enables scalability by running coverage analysis on multiple genomic regions in parallel.

* The final coverage count (34,298 reads in 1:1-1000000) provides insight into sequencing depth, helping assess the quality and completeness of genomic data.

* The workflow is efficient and reproducible, making it suitable for large-scale genomic analysis.

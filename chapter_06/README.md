# HTS Data Analysis with Rust-HTSlib

## 6.1. Introduction to HTS Data Structures and Formats

### experiment_6.1
Rust code demonstrates how to read a large BAM file, process coverage data in parallel using rayon, and collect the results in a thread-safe shared data structure and a minimal Nextflow workflow that invokes the Rust-based coverage_tool to process multiple genomic regions in parallel.


## 6.2. Parsing and Indexing Alignments

### experiment_6.2
Rust program calculates coverage over multiple genomic regions in parallel and the Nextflow workflow orchestrates ephemeral tasks for each genomic region by invoking the same coverage_tool binary described earlier.

## 6.3. Variant Call Format (VCF/BCF) Handling

### experiment_6.3
Rust code demonstrates how to filter a BCF file in parallel using rust-htslib, rayon, and additional Rust crates for robust error handling and logging and a Nextflow workflow that uses bcftools to slice out a specific genomic interval (the “chunk”) from a larger BCF file and then pipes the resulting records into our Rust-based bcf_filter_tool. 

## 6.4. Parallel and Distributed Processing of HTS Data

### experiment_6.4
Rust code demonstrating parallelized read counting in a BAM file across multiple genomic regions and the Nextflow script below orchestrates multiple stages: fetching BAM files (or alignment), running a Rust-based variant-calling or read-counting tool, and finally merging the resulting outputs.

## 6.5. Advanced Data Structures for HTS Analysis

### experiment_6.5
Rust code uses an interval tree for genomic coverage queries in Rust and the Nextflow workflow below aligned with the previously discussed Rust code that creates and queries interval trees for coverage data.

## 5.4. De Novo Assembly Approaches

### experiment_5.4
Rust code demonstrates a chunk-based strategy for building a k-mer count table and constructing a minimal de Bruijn graph from potentially large FASTQ inputs.

## 5.5. Variant Calling and Genotyping

### experiment_5.5
Rust code processes variant hypotheses for a single or multiple genomic positions in a parallel and chunked fashion. 
 
## 6.6. Quality Control and Error Modeling

### experiment_6.6
Rust code demonstrate parallel coverage and mismatch calculations from a BAM file, the following program uses the rust-htslib crate for reading alignments, rayon for concurrency, and anyhow for robust error handling and Nextflow code runs in compute environment, enabling highly parallel executions across HPC clusters or cloud platforms.

## 6.7. Integrative Analyses with Rust-HTSlib

### experiment_6.7
Rust code integrates read coverage and variant annotation and it demonstrates how developers might handle concurrency, logging, and error handling while reading data from a BAM file with rust-htslib, parsing variants from a BCF file, and annotating each variant with gene information loaded from a GFF and Nextflow scode, each pipeline stage runs in an ephemeral environment, whether on an HPC cluster or in the cloud, providing scalability and efficient use of resources. 

## 6.8. Summary and Future Directions

### experiment_6.8
Rust code demonstrates demonstrates how to create a command-line binary for computing coverage in a BAM file and Nextflow code, each task processes one BAM file and one genomic region in an ephemeral container, writes a partial coverage result, and then merges these partial outputs in a final stage.

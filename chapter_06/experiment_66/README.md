## 6.6. Quality Control and Error Modeling

### experiment_66

To demonstrate parallel coverage and mismatch calculations from a BAM file, the following program uses the rust-htslib crate for reading alignments, rayon for concurrency, and anyhow for robust error handling. The design can be integrated into larger pipelines managed by workflow engines like Nextflow or HPC schedulers such as SLURM or PBS. Additional libraries for deep learning (tch-rs) or advanced numeric operations (ndarray) can be introduced as needed, while the core concepts of safe concurrency and scalable data processing remain unchanged.

In this code, each region is handled by a parallel task through rayon, taking advantage of all available CPU cores. The rust-htslib crate allows efficient random access to the BAM file, assuming a corresponding index (BAI) is available. If a particular region fails to process (for instance, due to I/O errors or malformed data), the error is logged but does not crash the entire program, allowing other regions to complete. The anyhow crate provides a consolidated error-handling approach, wrapping lower-level errors with contextual information.

Because the data structure representing QC statistics (QCStats) is updated independently within each thread, concurrency issues such as data races are avoided. Rust’s type system and strict ownership rules ensure that each record is processed in isolation. After processing, final results are aggregated by iterating over the list of results. This pattern scales effectively in both HPC and cloud environments, where ephemeral containers can spin up for each chunk of the genome.

In more advanced implementations, mismatch counting would be replaced by detailed logic, comparing aligned read bases to a reference sequence or leveraging data from the CIGAR string. This can be combined with machine learning frameworks like tch-rs for neural inference or ndarray for large-scale numeric transformations. The key advantage of Rust remains clear: a combination of performance, safety, and concurrency support that helps prevent subtle bugs when dealing with massive genomic datasets.

Each process in the following Nextflow code runs in compute environment, enabling highly parallel executions across HPC clusters or cloud platforms. This flexibility allows for rapid scaling when analyzing large genomic datasets, while Rust’s performance and safety guarantees protect against concurrency issues.

In this pipeline, each stage corresponds to a separate process that can run concurrently. The collectQC step uses rust_qc_tool to extract coverage and mismatch information from each BAM file, storing the results in JSON format. The mergeQC step combines these individual JSON files into a single merged_qc.json, which might incorporate statistical modeling or dimensionality reduction for large cohorts. Finally, recalibrate uses the merged QC data to adjust base qualities or refine error estimates for each BAM.

This architecture is well-suited for HPC or cloud-native execution because Nextflow can distribute the tasks across nodes or containers, handling scheduling, retries, and resource allocation. Rust’s static binaries reduce container overhead, helping each ephemeral job start quickly, while the concurrency features from crates like rayon ensure that CPU resources are utilized efficiently. If advanced numerical computations are required—such as matrix transformations or machine learning models—developers can add ndarray or tch-rs to the Rust tool, allowing for deep integration of high-performance or AI-driven analytics without leaving the Rust ecosystem.

In industry, AI engineers and bioinformaticians often adopt these Rust-based workflows for large-scale clinical genomics, especially when verifying pipeline quality across hundreds or thousands of patient samples. Nextflow’s ephemeral containers ensure that each sample’s job is isolated, simplifying concurrency while maximizing resource utilization in the cloud. Several major institutions have reported success combining concurrency in Rust with HPC schedulers to achieve near-linear speedups in coverage analyses, mismatch profiling, and iterative base quality recalibration. By carefully merging partial statistics and applying robust error models, these pipelines reduce the chance of spurious variations, thereby expediting the journey from raw sequence data to actionable pharmaceutical or clinical insights.

#### How to run:

run main.rs in wsl:

```wsl
cargo run -- --bam sample1.bam --region chr1:1-32 | tee output.txt
```

(run main.rs with sample1.bam and region chr:1-32 as input parameter and save the output in output.txt)

run main.nf in wsl:

```wsl
nextflow run main.nf
```

run main.nf with this parameters:
params.sample_list = 'samples.txt'
params.region     = 'chr1:1-32'
params.mock = true  // Set to true to use mock commands for testing

#### Explanation of the Output
The output directory structure and files shown reflect the following stages in your Nextflow pipeline:

##### 1. Coverage Computation for Each BAM File (coverage_sampleX.bam.tsv):

* The pipeline starts by processing each BAM file (e.g., coverage_sample1.bam.tsv, coverage_sample2.bam.tsv).

* For each BAM file, the coverageComputation process generates a corresponding coverage file in TSV format. This file contains genomic coverage data for different regions (e.g., chromosomes, start and end positions) along with the depth of coverage.

* These coverage files represent the genomic regions covered by reads from the BAM files.

##### 2. Merging Coverage Files (merged_coverage.tsv):

* The mergeCoverage process combines the coverage files generated in the previous step. It outputs a single merged_coverage.tsv file, which consolidates coverage data across all input BAM files.

* This file serves as the base for subsequent querying of intervals.

##### 3. Interval Querying (query_result_X-Y.tsv):

* The intervalQuery process runs the interval query tool (implemented in Rust) on the merged coverage data, performing queries for different genomic regions (e.g., query_result_50-60.tsv, query_result_40-70.tsv).

* The queries are based on the intervals specified in genome_intervals.txt. For each query, the tool searches for overlapping intervals within the merged coverage file.

* Each query result file (query_result_X-Y.tsv) contains the genomic regions (chromosomes, start, end, coverage) from the merged coverage data that overlap with the query interval (e.g., 50-60, 40-70, etc.).

#### Summary of the Output:
* The output directories correspond to different stages of the workflow, with each step having its own unique files:

  * Coverage Files (coverage_sampleX.bam.tsv): Represent the computed coverage data for each BAM file.

  * Merged Coverage (merged_coverage.tsv): The consolidated coverage data across all BAM files.

  * Query Results (query_result_X-Y.tsv): The results of the interval queries, showing the overlaps with specific genomic ranges.

Here’s a breakdown of the output files:

* Experiment 64 has several subdirectories that correspond to the different stages of the workflow.

  * Each subdirectory contains the output files from coverage computation, merging, and interval querying.

  * The query result files (query_result_X-Y.tsv) contain the intervals that match the query ranges and overlap with the merged coverage.

For example, the file query_result_50-60.tsv contains the results of querying the merged coverage file for intervals that overlap with the range 50-60. Similarly, the other query_result_X-Y.tsv files contain the results for other genomic intervals (e.g., 1-10, 20-40, etc.).

#### Conclusion:
* The pipeline works as expected by processing BAM files to compute coverage, merging the coverage data, and running interval queries on the merged data.

* Each output directory corresponds to a specific task in the pipeline, and the generated files provide useful data for genomic analysis.

  * Coverage files are essential for understanding how different regions of the genome are covered by reads in the input BAM files.

  * Merged coverage combines these files into a single dataset that facilitates easier querying and analysis.

  * Query results provide the intervals from the merged coverage that match the genomic intervals specified in the queries, giving insight into the regions of the genome that were covered at different depths.

* This approach efficiently handles large genomic data sets by leveraging Nextflow's parallelism and the Rust-based interval tree querying tool, ensuring scalability and fast querying.

You can now use these results to further analyze coverage patterns, genomic region overlaps, or any other bioinformatics tasks related to the coverage data.

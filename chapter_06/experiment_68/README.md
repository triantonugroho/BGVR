## 6.8. Summary and Future Directions

### experiment_68

The following Rust program demonstrates how to create a command-line binary for computing coverage in a BAM file. It uses clap (successor to structopt) for argument parsing, anyhow for robust error handling, and rust-htslib for BAM/CRAM indexing and iteration. This design is ideal for HPC or cloud pipelines orchestrated by Nextflow. Each workflow step can be containerized with Docker or Singularity to guarantee reproducible environments, ensuring that the Rust toolchain and associated system libraries remain consistent across clusters or cloud providers.

This revised tool reads the user-specified BAM file and region, calculates the number of aligned reads in that region, and writes the final coverage count to a text file. It relies on indexed access, so a corresponding BAI file is necessary for random queries. The usage of anyhow and env_logger ensures that errors are contextualized and logged appropriately, which aids debugging in large-scale HPC or cloud runs. When tasks are parallelized—either by chunking the genome into multiple regions or distributing sample sets across HPC nodes—each ephemeral container or compute node runs this binary and writes its partial result to a file or object store, minimizing memory usage and total runtime.

If more advanced machine learning operations are needed, the tch-rs crate can inject PyTorch-based neural networks directly into the workflow, while ndarray enables vectorized numeric computations on coverage matrices. Projects that require on-the-fly data querying can integrate libraries like polar or polars for structured queries, and linfa for classical machine learning algorithms. Regardless of additional complexity, Rust’s strong type system and concurrency model help keep large genomic pipelines reliable and maintainable, while containerization ensures consistent environments across HPC clusters or cloud platforms.

In the following Nextflow code, each task processes one BAM file and one genomic region in an ephemeral container, writes a partial coverage result, and then merges these partial outputs in a final stage. This design is typical for HPC or cloud pipelines managed by Nextflow, ensuring each container only handles a subset of the data while logging and versioning can be standardized for robust industrial usage.

In this workflow, the coverageCalc process uses the rust_coverage_tool compiled from the code shown previously. Each ephemeral container processes a unique BAM file and genomic region, writing coverage results to coverage_<BAM>_<REGION>.txt. Nextflow’s channel mechanics collect the outputs, passing them to mergeCoverage, which concatenates all partial results into merged_coverage.txt. This pattern allows high-throughput computation on large cohorts or extensive genomic intervals, as Nextflow can scale out tasks onto multiple HPC nodes or cloud instances.

In production pipelines, one often adds more robust error handling (e.g., retries for transient failures), logging strategies (potentially with structured logs that can be aggregated by tools like the ELK stack), and versioning (ensuring that each container runs a fixed version of Rust and the coverage tool). Such practices foster reproducibility and traceability, whether you are working on a single workstation or a massive cloud cluster.

#### How to run:

run main.rs in wsl:

```wsl
cargo run -- --bam test1.bam --region chr1:1-100 --out coverage_result.txt
```

(run main.rs with test1.bam, region chr1:1-100 as input parameter and save the output in coverage_result.txt)

run main.nf in wsl:

```wsl
nextflow run main.nf
```

run main.nf with this parameters:
params.bam_list     = 'bams.txt'
params.region_list  = 'regions.txt'
params.outdir       = '.' // Default to current directory

#### [dependencies]

```toml
anyhow = "1.0"
clap = { version = "4.4", features = ["derive"] }
log = "0.4"
env_logger = "0.11"
rust-htslib = "0.49.0"
```

#### Explanation of the Output
##### 🦀 main.rs (Rust program)
###### ✅ What it does:
The rust_coverage_tool:

1. Takes 3 arguments: --bam, --region, and --out
2. Opens the BAM file with an index
3. Fetches all mapped reads in the specified region
4. Counts how many records (reads) are found
5. Writes that count (a number) to an output file

###### 🔍 Example:
```rust
cargo run -- --bam test1.bam --region chr1:1-100 --out coverage_result.txt
```

This prints:

```rust
Computing coverage for region chr1:1-100 in BAM test1.bam
Coverage result: 1
```

###### 📝 Output file coverage_result.txt contains:
```text
1
```

This means one read overlaps with region chr1:1-100.

##### 🚀 main.nf (Nextflow pipeline)
###### ✅ What it does:
1. Reads all BAM paths from bams.txt
2. Reads all regions from regions.txt
3. Indexes BAMs with samtools index
4. Combines each BAM with each region (Cartesian product)
5. Runs your Rust tool for every BAM/region pair
6. Collects all coverage output files
7. Merges them into a single file merged_coverage.txt

###### 📁 Inputs:
bams.txt contains:

```text
test1.bam
```

And your regions.txt contains:

```text
chr1:1-100
chr1:200-300
```

→ Total combinations = 1 BAM × 2 regions = 2 runs of rust_coverage_tool.

###### 📦 Output: merged_coverage.txt
The pipeline creates two coverage output files, like:

* coverage_test1.bam_chr1_1_100.txt → contains 1
* coverage_test1.bam_chr1_200_300.txt → contains 0

Then the mergeCoverage process runs:

```wsl
echo "# Merged coverage results" > merged_coverage.txt
cat coverage_* >> merged_coverage.txt
```

✅ So your merged_coverage.txt will be:

```text
# Merged coverage results
1
0
```

That just means the file order may vary depending on file system order — both are correct.

#### ✅ Final Summary

main.rs:
* Works as expected — reads a BAM, counts alignments overlapping a region, and outputs a count.

main.nf:
* Runs main.rs for every BAM/region pair, collects all results, and merges them.

##### 🎯 Output explanation:
* Each line after the header is the read count in one region.
* A 0 means no reads aligned to that region.
* A 1 means one read was aligned.

#### ✅ Conclusion
* Your Rust coverage tool is functioning correctly.
* Your Nextflow pipeline successfully automates running this tool over multiple BAMs/regions.
* The output merged_coverage.txt shows the read counts per region, matching expectations.

## 4.8. Summary of Key Functional Genomics Algorithms

### experiment_48

For an AI engineer, implementing key functional genomics algorithms in Rust typically involves modular code design, concurrency best practices, and HPC orchestration. A well-structured Rust project might separate domain-specific modules, such as eqtl, motif, or splicing, each with subroutines for file I/O, HPC concurrency patterns, or data transformations. Shared crates like rayon facilitate parallel iteration, while memmap2 enables memory-mapped file access for large references, and tch-rs can be invoked for advanced deep learning tasks, such as CNN-based motif discovery. The code snippet below illustrates how one might perform a partial merge of multi-omics results—epigenetic signals, eQTL associations, and motif hits—into an integrated table. We briefly comment on each crate used.

The snippet uses serde for reading and writing JSON, rayon for concurrency, and standard Rust I/O utilities to handle partial merges. In an industrial-scale setting, ephemeral HPC containers might each produce eqtl_partX.json, peak_partX.json, or motif_partX.json for different genomic intervals or subsets of a large consortium dataset. After partial merges, the final integrated file can be used for downstream analyses, such as identifying variants that disrupt regulatory elements and alter gene expression. This approach is in line with HPC best practices, as partial merges minimize memory usage on each node while still achieving high throughput (Johnson et al. (2024)). Additional considerations like logging, error handling, and memory-mapping large files can further increase reliability in production environments.

#### How to run:

run main.rs in powershell:

```powershell
cargo run | tee output.txt
```

(run main.rs and get the partial_adjacency.bin output and output.txt)

#### [dependencies]

```toml
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
rayon = "1.10.0"
reqwest = { version = "0.12.14", features = ["blocking", "json"] }
```

#### Explanation of the Output
This Rust program integrates multi-omics data by combining eQTL associations, peak calls, and motif hits into a single dataset. The merged results are written to integrated.json.

#####  Output Breakdown

###### 1. Console Output (output.txt)

```rust
Downloading data/eqtl_part1.json...
Downloaded: data/eqtl_part1.json
Downloading data/eqtl_part2.json...
Downloaded: data/eqtl_part2.json
Downloading data/peak_part1.json...
Downloaded: data/peak_part1.json
Downloading data/motif_part1.json...
Downloaded: data/motif_part1.json
```

Explanation:

* The program loads eQTL, peak, and motif data from JSON files.
* These files contain precomputed results from various genomic experiments.
* The program processes these files in parallel using rayon, which improves performance on large datasets.

###### 2. Integrated Data (integrated.json)

```json
[
  {
    "snp_id": "rs789033",
    "gene_id": "ENSG781584707921",
    "p_value": 0.204807,
    "peak_id": null,
    "motif_id": null
  },
  {
    "snp_id": "rs773185",
    "gene_id": "ENSG709182318666",
    "p_value": 0.68261,
    "peak_id": null,
    "motif_id": null
  },
  {
    "snp_id": "rs235176",
    "gene_id": "ENSG913807581238",
    "p_value": 0.919093,
    "peak_id": null,
    "motif_id": null
  },
  {
    "snp_id": "rs823958",
    "gene_id": "ENSG871011481629",
    "p_value": 0.489633,
    "peak_id": null,
    "motif_id": null
  },
  ...
  {
    "snp_id": "rs621222",
    "gene_id": "ENSG327096809381",
    "p_value": 0.824804,
    "peak_id": null,
    "motif_id": null
  }
]
```

Explanation:

* Each row represents an eQTL association between a SNP (snp_id) and a gene (gene_id).
* The p-value indicates the strength of the statistical association (lower values suggest stronger evidence).
* peak_id and motif_id are null for all entries because no peaks or motifs were matched in the dummy logic.
  * In real-world cases, these fields would contain identifiers if the SNP overlapped a regulatory peak or a transcription factor binding motif.

#### Conclusion
* The program successfully integrates eQTL, peak call, and motif hit data into a structured JSON output.
* Parallel processing with rayon speeds up the integration process.
* No SNPs matched peaks or motifs, meaning:
  * The simple string-based matching logic does not align genomic coordinates.
  * Real-world integration would require genomic overlap analysis using tools like BED files or interval trees.

# 4. Data Structures and Algorithms for Genomics

## 4.1. Introduction to Functional Genomics Data Structures

### experiment_4.1
Rust code demonstrates a workflow for reading a synthetic FASTQ file to build a Position Weight Matrix (PWM) and then a simple Markov Random Field (MRF) using Rust.

## 4.2. Graph-Based Models for Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs)

### experiment_4.2
Nexflow pipeline and Rust code demonstrate how to compute a correlation-based adjacency matrix from a synthetic gene expression dataset using both Rust and Nextflow. 

## 4.3. Motif Discovery and Regulatory Element Identification

### experiment_4.3_1
Rust code demonstrates a minimal hidden Markov model (HMM) for a motif-finding scenario, treating “motif” and “non-motif” as distinct states in a DNA sequence.

### experiment_4.3_2
Rust code illustrates a simplified expectation-maximization (EM) procedure for discovering motifs, loosely inspired by MEME (Johnson et al. (2024)).

### experiment_4.3_3
Rust code shows how one might implement a parallelized Gibbs sampling routine for motif discovery.

### experiment_4.3_4
Rust code scans DNA sequences for TATA-like motifs in a robust and scalable way.

### experiment_4.3_5
Nextflow pipeline and Rust code demonstrates how to chunk genomic data, scan for motifs in parallel with Rust and the rayon crate, and merge partial results into a final output.

## 4.4. Epigenomic Data Integration and Algorithms

### experiment_4.4
Rust code demonstrates a streamlined approach for calling peaks (e.g., regions of high signal intensity) on genomic coverage data, which might arise from experiments like ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq.

## 4.5. Transcriptomics and Alternative Splicing Algorithms

### experiment_4.5
Rust code demonstrates a straightforward approach to building and merging partial splicing graphs, which represent gene transcripts by connecting exons and splice junctions.
 
## 4.6. Single-Cell Functional Genomics

### experiment_4.6_1
Rust code demonstrates a parallelized approach to constructing a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graph for a set of single-cell data, a common task in bioinformatics pipelines where large datasets must be efficiently processed. 

### experiment_4.6_2
Nextflow code provides a high-performance, parallel implementation of sparse matrix–vector multiplication using the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format.

## 4.7. eQTL Mapping and Functional Variant Discovery

### experiment_4.7
Rust code demonstrates a parallel solution for computing eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) associations between SNP data and gene expression data.

## 4.8. Summary of Key Functional Genomics Algorithms

### experiment_4.8
Rust code illustrates how one might perform a partial merge of multi-omics results—epigenetic signals, eQTL associations, and motif hits—into an integrated table.

## 3.6. Putting It All Together—Rust and Nextflow Integration

### experiment_3.6_1

#### 1. Nextflow

A successful workflow often adopts a modular approach: each step—like read preprocessing, index building, alignment, variant calling, or summarization—is implemented as a distinct Rust crate. This design encourages reusability and testing. A Rust developer might create a rust_index_builder crate that constructs a partial FM-index or Bloom filter for each portion of a reference genome. Another crate, rust_aligner, implements local or global alignments, optionally calling advanced HPC patterns (e.g., wavefront alignment on GPUs). The final pieces, such as rust_graph_assembler, handle large de Bruijn or overlap graph merges.

This code illustrates how a Rust-based bioinformatics pipeline might be divided into multiple steps—building partial indexes from genomic data, performing alignments, and merging partial graphs—each handled by a dedicated module (simulating distinct crates). In a real HPC environment, ephemeral containers could process different regions or read subsets in parallel, storing partial FM-index or Bloom filters, alignment results, and local graph fragments, then combining these partial outputs in a final orchestration step.

The code demonstrates a modular HPC workflow in Rust, simulating distinct crates as modules. The rust_index_builder module provides a build_partial_index function that might construct partial FM-index or Bloom filters, while rust_aligner implements an alignment routine (in this case, a trivial placeholder enhanced by the rayon crate for parallel iteration). Finally, the rust_graph_assembler module merges partial data into a single global structure, representing how ephemeral containers might each handle one part of the data, then unify their results in a final assembly step. This design pattern, combined with ephemeral HPC resources or orchestration frameworks like Nextflow, allows large genomics pipelines to be broken into smaller, maintainable Rust crates

#### 2. Rust
From an AI engineering standpoint, bridging Rust and Nextflow is straightforward once the Rust crates are containerized with Docker or Singularity. Each crate is built and tested with cargo test, ensuring correctness. Nextflow picks up these containers, passing parameters and input files as directed in the pipeline. Below is a small pipeline example that shows how partial FM-index building, alignment, and summarization integrate into a single HPC workflow. To illustrate, we provide sample Rust code for each crate, encouraging you to expand or modify for real-world tasks.

```rust
[project layout]
rust-bio-pipeline/
├── index-builder/
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/main.rs
├── aligner/
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/main.rs
├── summarizer/
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/main.rs
└── nextflow/
    └── main.nf
```

Each subdirectory is a self-contained Rust project. For instance, index-builder might use the needletail crate for reading FASTA files and rayon for concurrency. If HPC-level performance is sought, you could add tch-rs for GPU-accelerated string analysis or ndarray for advanced matrix operations.

This code demonstrates a naive “FM-index building” step, in practice. Real HPC solutions for partial FM-index building would replace the placeholder with code that actually computes a partial Burrows–Wheeler Transform. The ephemeral container concept allows multiple nodes each to run this binary on distinct reference slices. They collectively write partial outputs, then a final job merges them into one comprehensive FM-index.

#### Project Structure:

```plaintext
experiment_3.6_1/
└── Cargo.toml                      # Rust project configuration and dependencies
experiment_36_1/src/                 # Note: Directory name has a typo (missing 'e')
├── main.rs                         # Main Rust script containing program logic
├── main.nf                         # Nextflow workflow script
├── reference.fa                    # Reference FASTA file
├── partial_fm_indexes.json         # JSON output file containing partial FM-indexes
└── output.txt                      # Text output file
```

#### Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "experiment_3.6_1"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
```

#### How to run:

run in powershell:

```powershell
cargo run main.nf | tee output.txt
```

(run main.nf and save the output in output.txt)
  

#### Explanation of the Output

##### 1. Output from main.rs
The main.rs script processes a reference genome file (reference.fa), chunks it into segments of a specified size (default: 1,000,000 characters), and creates partial FM-index placeholders for each chunk. The output indicates:

* Message in output.txt:
```rust
Created partial_fm_indexes.json with 1 chunks.
```

This means that only one chunk was created, which suggests that the input reference file was smaller than the defined chunk size.

* partial_fm_indexes.json Content:

```json
[
  {
    "reference_chunk": "chunk_0",
    "bwt_data": [47, 47, 32, 84, 104, 105, 115, 32, 101, 120, 97, 109, ...]
  }
]
```

This JSON file contains:

* "reference_chunk": "chunk_0" → Indicates the name of the chunk (first chunk).
* "bwt_data": [...] → Stores the raw bytes of that chunk. This data would typically be used for suffix arrays or BWT transformations in indexing.

##### 2. Output from main.nf
The main.nf script simulates an HPC pipeline where multiple processing steps happen in parallel, including:

* Indexing (rust_index_builder) → Creates a partial index from reference regions.
* Alignment (rust_aligner) → Simulates read alignment.
* Graph Assembly (rust_graph_assembler) → Builds graphs from indexes and alignment scores.

The output includes:

```rust
Building partial graph for region: chr1_partA
Found alignment result: query_id=readA, score=10
Found alignment result: query_id=readB, score=10
Building partial graph for region: chr1_partB
Found alignment result: query_id=readC, score=10
Found alignment result: query_id=readD, score=10
Global Graph: PartialGraph { node_count: 72 }
```

This means:

* Two partial graphs were built (for chr1_partA and chr1_partB).
* Each read gets a score based on length.
* The final merged graph has 72 nodes.

#### Conclusion

##### 1. main.rs (Partial FM-Index Generation)

* Successfully creates partial FM-index placeholders for reference genome segments.
* The reference file was small, so only one chunk was generated.
* This method could be used in large-scale genomic indexing for fast searching.

##### 2. main.nf (HPC-Style Bioinformatics Pipeline)

* Simulates an HPC workflow, where:
  * Indexing builds local indexes.
  * Alignment assigns scores to reads.
  * Graph assembly merges results.
* Successfully merges data from multiple regions into a single final graph.

#### Key Takeaways
* The pipeline demonstrates how bioinformatics workflows scale using modular Rust components.
* The FM-indexing approach allows efficient reference genome compression and searching.
* The pipeline could be expanded with real bioinformatics algorithms for actual sequencing data analysis.

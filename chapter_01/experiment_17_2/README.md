A GNN-based approach, albeit simplified, to model relationships in a gene expression matrix.

In practical terms, bioinformatics workflows increasingly adopt an AI-engineer perspective, leveraging concurrency and HPC optimization. GPU clusters process large matrix factorizations for tasks like eQTL mapping, while specialized concurrency frameworks speed up sequence alignment. In Rust, popular crates like “ndarray” or “nalgebra” help implement advanced linear algebra in a memory-safe environment. “rust-bio” simplifies fundamental bioinformatics tasks like parsing FASTQ or Fasta files, and concurrency is handled gracefully via “rayon” or “tokio.” Below is sample Rust code demonstrating a GNN-based approach, albeit simplified, to model relationships in a gene expression matrix.

In this condensed illustration, “ndarray” and “nalgebra” manage matrix operations. The adjacency map mimics a GNN’s neighborhood structure, and concurrency is employed through “rayon”’s parallel iterators. Even though this code omits real-world complexities—such as normalizing data, layering multiple GNN operations, or integrated HPC scheduling—it exemplifies the reliability and performance typical of Rust for large bioinformatics tasks. To scale further, engineers can refine memory allocation, distribute computations across HPC clusters, or incorporate GPU kernels for matrix multiplications.

Several success stories document how re-engineering legacy scripts into Rust-based components yielded faster data preprocessing and more stable HPC runs, ultimately shortening drug candidate pipelines. The synergy between concurrency, memory safety, and containerized deployment resonates in regulated environments, where reproducibility and audit trails are paramount. Large consortia analyzing population-level data also benefit from these standardized pipelines, as collaborative teams can trust that results are both scalable and reproducible.

#### Files contents:
* main.rs (rust script)
* main.nf (nextflow script)
* Cargo.toml (Cargo.toml file)

#### How to run:

cargo run main.nf 

(run the nextflow script that will run the main.rs and save the output in output.txt)
  
#### [dependencies]

nalgebra = "0.33.2"

ndarray = "0.16.1"

rayon = "1.10.0"

rand = "0.9"

#### Explanation of the Output

The output represents the updated node features after one iteration of a GNN-based message passing process. Here’s a breakdown:

##### 1. Expression Data Shape (100 x 10)

* The initial node features are stored in a 100 x 10 matrix, meaning there are 100 nodes, each with a 10-dimensional feature vector.

##### 2. Updated Node Features Shape (100 x 10)

* After applying the aggregation step in gene_gnn_iteration, the output matrix remains 100 x 10, preserving the number of nodes and feature dimensions.

##### 3. Feature Updates

* Each row represents a node, and each column corresponds to a specific feature dimension.
* The values in each row are computed as the mean of the feature values of the node's neighbors.
* Nodes with more similar neighbors will have more averaged feature values, leading to a smoothing effect.

##### 4. Interpretation of Values

The numbers represent feature values after aggregation, typically in the range of [0, 1] (since the initial values were randomly generated).
Some values may be higher or lower depending on the connectivity of the nodes in the adjacency list.
This output essentially reflects how information is propagated between connected nodes in the graph.

#### Conclusion

The program successfully performed one iteration of message passing in the GNN, updating node features based on the mean aggregation of their neighbors. This transformation allows nodes to incorporate information from their local graph structure, making the data more suitable for downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or biomarker discovery in gene expression analysis.

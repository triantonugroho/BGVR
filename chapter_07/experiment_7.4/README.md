## 7.4. Advanced Processing for Complex Genomic Scenarios

### experiment_7.4

Graph-based references, or advanced data structures for dense/sparse variation, often demand specialized software. Rust is increasingly favored because concurrency at this scale can lead to subtle memory corruption in lower-level languages. The snippet below demonstrates a simplified Rust function for merging single-sample VCFs into a preliminary multi-sample VCF, confirming consistent contigs and sample IDs. Though a fully featured multi-sample merge might require coordinate-based matching of variant positions, this example illustrates how concurrency, error handling, and HPC synergy might be organized.
This code memory-maps the file and splits it by newlines in memory, though real-world usage might parse FASTA headers and sequences more intelligently. The concurrency arises naturally when we process lines in parallel with .par_iter(). For HPC usage, ephemeral containers can each map the file, process an assigned slice, and combine partial results in a final stage.

In a production HPC context, ephemeral tasks may each handle a subset of input VCF files, producing intermediate merges. Another ephemeral task merges those partial merges. The code ensures that contigs are consistent, logs warnings for unknown contigs, and uses the Rust type system to enforce error handling. For more advanced tasks like structural variant validation, or merging partial graphs of a DAG-based reference, developers might rely on adjacency lists in memory structures or HPC parallel DFS approaches. Crates such as ndarray could store adjacency matrices for denser subgraphs, while tch-rs might facilitate AI-based classification of structural variants.

Below is a Nextflow pipeline illustrating ephemeral HPC tasks that merge sets of single-sample VCFs and then run a structural variant check on the final result. This ephemeral model is popular when large consortia store many small VCFs representing thousands of samples.

In HPC or cloud infrastructures, ephemeral tasks each handle a chunk of the sample listâ€”say, five single-sample VCF filesâ€”and produce partial merges. The final merge merges those partial merges into a single multi-sample VCF. The svCheck step runs an advanced structural variant check on the consolidated result. Each ephemeral container uses a Docker or Singularity image that includes Rust-based binaries (rust_vcf_merge_tool, rust_svcheck_tool). For even larger HPC tasks, developers might chunk the genome itself, analyzing structural variants region by region (Smith et al. (2020)).

#### Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "rust_vcf_merge_tool"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

[dependencies]
anyhow = "1.0"
clap = { version = "4.0", features = ["derive"] }
rayon = "1.5"

```

#### How to run:

run main.rs in wsl:

```wsl
cargo run -- --vcf-list vcf_list.txt --out merged.vcf --threads 4 --format bcf | tee output.txt
```

(run main.rs with vcf_list.txt using 4 threads as input parameter and merged.vcf as output file and formatted to bcf file and save the text output in output.txt)

run main.nf in wsl:

```wsl
nextflow run main.nf
```

run main.nf with this parameters:
params.sample_list = 'vcf_list.txt'
params.output_vcf = 'merged.vcf'
params.threads = 4
params.format = 'bcf'
params.tool_path = "/mnt/c/Users/trian/BGVR/chapter_07/experiment_7.4/target/debug/rust_vcf_merge_tool"


#### Explanation of the Output
##### ðŸ¦€ main.rs (Rust): Output Explanation
This file contains a Rust program designed to merge multiple VCF files into a single, multi-sample VCF or BCF. When executed, it produces:

###### ðŸ”¹ merged.vcf or merged.bcf
* Created by the rust_vcf_merge_tool.
* The merged output of all VCF files listed in vcf_list.txt.
* Stored in the working directory or wherever the --out parameter points to.
* The example you gave used BCF format (--format bcf), resulting in:

```text
merged_vcf.bcf
```

###### ðŸ”¹ output.txt (stdout)
* Contains a log message from the tool:

```text
Merge completed in 28 ms
```

* Shows successful completion and performance timing.

##### ðŸ§¬ main.nf (Nextflow): Output Explanation
This file defines a Nextflow pipeline that automates the execution of the Rust merging tool and then generates a simple HTML report.

###### ðŸ”¹ Workflow Breakdown
###### âœ… Step 1: mergeVCF process
* Takes:
  * vcf_list.txt (VCF paths)
  * All .vcf files in the same directory
* Writes local_vcf_list.txt (a new list with local paths) to ensure compatibility with the Rust tool.
  * Runs the compiled Rust binary rust_vcf_merge_tool
  * Produces:
    * merged_vcf.bcf

###### âœ… Step 2: generateReport process
* Takes:
  * merged_vcf.bcf from the previous step
  * Runs a reporting command (simulated with fallback HTML generation)
* Produces:
  * pipeline_report.html

###### ðŸ“‚ Output Directory: /mnt/c/Users/trian/BGVR/chapter_07/experiment_74/src/results/
You will find:
* merged_vcf.bcf â€“ The merged variant file
* pipeline_report.html â€“ A simple HTML summary

```html
<html><body><h1>Report for merged_vcf.bcf</h1><p>Processing complete.</p></body></html>
```

#### âœ… Conclusion
You have successfully:

* ðŸ“¦ Written a Rust CLI tool to efficiently merge VCF files.

* ðŸ”„ Wrapped the tool in a Nextflow pipeline to automate and scale the merging + reporting process.

* ðŸ§ª Verified correct functionality with structured output:

  * The merge was completed (merged_vcf.bcf)
  * A simple report was generated (pipeline_report.html)

This setup is now modular, reproducible, and ready to handle more complex VCF workflows or plug into larger bioinformatics pipelines.

## 7.2. Advanced Algorithms for High-Throughput Genomic Data

### experiment_72

In real HPC or cloud settings, developers combine these advanced algorithms with ephemeral container tasks that handle partial data merges. The snippet below, written in an AI engineer style, shows a simplified Rust program that simulates partial suffix array or k-mer index construction for large references. By dividing the reference into slices and building partial indexes concurrently, developers can harness HPC concurrency or ephemeral VMs in the cloud. The code uses rayon, a commonly used concurrency crate in Rust, but developers can also use crossbeam or asynchronous frameworks like tokio if suitable for their pipeline.

Key crates used here include rayon for concurrency and HashMap from Rust‚Äôs standard library. Developers might add tch-rs for GPU-accelerated steps or ndarray for array-based computations if k-mer data needs more advanced numerical manipulations. For industrial-scale usage, error handling around I/O, memory constraints, or concurrency failures is essential. Often, ephemeral tasks use only a fraction of the total data, and if one task fails, the pipeline can retry or skip that chunk.

Below is a Nextflow script that demonstrates how ephemeral container tasks are orchestrated in practice. It chunks a reference file, runs the Rust-based index construction on each chunk, then merges partial outputs. This approach seamlessly scales to HPC clusters (e.g., Slurm) or cloud orchestration systems (e.g., AWS Batch, Google Cloud Life Sciences).

In real pipelines, ephemeral tasks reduce overhead by releasing resources once each chunk is processed. AI engineers typically include robust logs, handle partial failures gracefully, and ensure the container images specify consistent Rust versions to guarantee reproducible builds. If HPC concurrency is used, tasks might map 20‚Äì50 coverage or variant chunks onto each node, balancing CPU and memory constraints carefully. Nextflow monitors all tasks, merging partial indexes only when every chunk completes successfully.

#### How to run:

run main.rs in wsl:

```wsl
cargo run -- --vcf-file cohort.vcf --bam-files sample1.sorted.bam,sample2.sorted.bam | tee output.txt
```

(run main.rs with cohort.vcf, sample1.sorted.bam and sample2.sorted.bam as input parameter and save the output in coverage_output.txt)

run main.nf in wsl:

```wsl
nextflow run main.nf
```

run main.nf with this parameters:
params.bam_list = "bams.txt"
params.vcf_file = "cohort.vcf"
params.rust_bin = "/mnt/c/Users/trian/BGVR/chapter_07/experiment_71/target/debug"

#### [dependencies]

```toml
noodles = { version = "0.5", features = ["bam", "core", "vcf"] }
rayon = "1.5.1"
clap = { version = "4", features = ["derive"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
log = "0.4"
env_logger = "0.11.8"
thiserror = "2.0.12"
anyhow = "1.0"
```

#### Explanation of the Output
##### ‚úÖ main.rs Explanation (Rust CLI Tool)
This Rust program performs basic BAM file parsing using the noodles crate, and it‚Äôs structured as a CLI tool. Here's what happens when it's executed:

######üí° Input Parameters:
* --vcf-file cohort.vcf: Not parsed (VCF parsing is not enabled yet, just logged).
* --bam-files sample1.sorted.bam,sample2.sorted.bam: Comma-separated paths of BAM files to be processed in parallel using Rayon.

###### üß† Main Workflow:
1. Logging Init: Logging is initialized via env_logger.
2. Argument Parsing: The CLI args are parsed using clap.
3. VCF Handling: It simply logs that the VCF file is acknowledged, but real parsing is skipped (VCF feature not enabled).
4. Parallel BAM Processing:
   * Each BAM file is opened with noodles::bam::Reader.  
   * It reads headers and reference sequences.
   * For each BAM:
     * Logs header and up to 2 reference sequences.
     * Reads records one by one, printing the first 5 records‚Äô positions, MAPQ, and CIGAR.
     * Counts the total number of records read.
5. Final line confirms all BAMs have been processed.

##### ‚úÖ main.nf Explanation (Nextflow Pipeline)
Nextflow script wraps the above binary and controls its execution in a reproducible workflow.

###### üí° Parameters Used:
* params.bam_list = "bams.txt": List of BAM files (line-separated).
* params.vcf_file = "cohort.vcf": Single VCF file path.
* params.rust_bin = "/mnt/c/.../debug": Folder containing the compiled binary rust_noodles_coverage.

###### üß† Process rustCoverageRunner:
* Input:
  * bams.txt (as bam_list_file)
  * cohort.vcf
* The bam_list_file is converted into a comma-separated string using:

```wsl
BAM_FILES=$(cat bams.txt | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')
```

* The binary is executed like this:

```wsl
rust_noodles_coverage --vcf-file cohort.vcf --bam-files "sample1.sorted.bam,sample2.sorted.bam"
```

* Output is redirected to coverage_output.txt.

###### üì§ Output: coverage_output.txt
Contents:

```txt
Starting BAM processing application...
VCF file noted: cohort.vcf (VCF processing not enabled)
Add 'vcf' to noodles features in Cargo.toml to enable VCF processing
Processing 2 BAM files...
Processing BAM file: sample1.sorted.bam
Processing BAM file: sample2.sorted.bam
Processing completed successfully
```

This is expected based on the println!() calls in your Rust main.rs. Because BAM parsing is done, but only limited record info is printed, the output is minimal.

#### ‚úÖ Conclusion
‚úÖ Integration Success: Your Rust binary was successfully integrated into a Nextflow pipeline.

‚úÖ Inputs Correctly Wired: bams.txt was read and transformed properly into CLI format for Rust tool.

‚úÖ Parallelism Works: Your BAM files were processed in parallel inside main.rs using Rayon.

‚ö†Ô∏è VCF Functionality Not Implemented: Your tool acknowledges the VCF but doesn‚Äôt use it yet‚Äîfuture feature.

üìÅ Output Location: Since Nextflow runs in isolated work directories, the output coverage_output.txt appears in a work subfolder (experiment_71/src/work/fc/...), and can be collected later with publishDir or saved explicitly.

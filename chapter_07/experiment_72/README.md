## 7.2. Advanced Algorithms for High-Throughput Genomic Data

### experiment_72

In real HPC or cloud settings, developers combine these advanced algorithms with ephemeral container tasks that handle partial data merges. The snippet below, written in an AI engineer style, shows a simplified Rust program that simulates partial suffix array or k-mer index construction for large references. By dividing the reference into slices and building partial indexes concurrently, developers can harness HPC concurrency or ephemeral VMs in the cloud. The code uses rayon, a commonly used concurrency crate in Rust, but developers can also use crossbeam or asynchronous frameworks like tokio if suitable for their pipeline.

Key crates used here include rayon for concurrency and HashMap from Rust‚Äôs standard library. Developers might add tch-rs for GPU-accelerated steps or ndarray for array-based computations if k-mer data needs more advanced numerical manipulations. For industrial-scale usage, error handling around I/O, memory constraints, or concurrency failures is essential. Often, ephemeral tasks use only a fraction of the total data, and if one task fails, the pipeline can retry or skip that chunk.

Below is a Nextflow script that demonstrates how ephemeral container tasks are orchestrated in practice. It chunks a reference file, runs the Rust-based index construction on each chunk, then merges partial outputs. This approach seamlessly scales to HPC clusters (e.g., Slurm) or cloud orchestration systems (e.g., AWS Batch, Google Cloud Life Sciences).

In real pipelines, ephemeral tasks reduce overhead by releasing resources once each chunk is processed. AI engineers typically include robust logs, handle partial failures gracefully, and ensure the container images specify consistent Rust versions to guarantee reproducible builds. If HPC concurrency is used, tasks might map 20‚Äì50 coverage or variant chunks onto each node, balancing CPU and memory constraints carefully. Nextflow monitors all tasks, merging partial indexes only when every chunk completes successfully.

#### How to run:

run main.rs in wsl:

```wsl
cargo run -- --input reference.fa --output global_index.json | tee output.txt
```

(run main.rs with reference.fa as input parameter and global_index.json as output file and save the output text as output.txt)

run main.nf in wsl:

```wsl
nextflow run main.nf
```

run main.nf with this parameters:
params.ref_file      = 'reference.fa'
params.kmer_length   = 31
params.chunk_size    = 1000000
params.outdir        = 'results'
params.threads       = Runtime.runtime.availableProcessors()

#### [dependencies]

```toml
clap = { version = "4.5", features = ["derive"] }
rayon = "1.8"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

#### Explanation of the Output
##### üîç Main Output Explanation
###### ü¶Ä main.rs (Rust CLI Tool)
This tool builds a global k-mer frequency index from a reference DNA sequence.

##### ‚úÖ Key Steps and Output:
1. Reads reference.fa:
   * Contains DNA sequences.
2. Splits into overlapping chunks (in memory):
   * Each chunk of size 1,000,000 bp with overlap of k-1 = 30 bp to ensure k-mers are not split across boundaries.
3. Generates partial indexes in parallel:
   * Using Rayon threads, k-mers (length 31) are extracted and counted per chunk.
4. Merges partial indexes:
   * Final global map is written as global_index.json.

##### ‚úÖ Output:
* global_index.json: JSON object mapping each valid k-mer to its total count across the whole sequence.

###### üìÑ Example (simplified):
```text
{
  "ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACG": 7,
  "GTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTA": 6,
  ...
}
```

##### üöÄ main.nf (Nextflow Workflow)
This orchestrates the full pipeline ‚Äî chunking, indexing, and merging ‚Äî using the same logic.

###### ‚úÖ Processes:
1. chunkReference:
   * Uses awk to split the FASTA file into chunks with overlap.
   * Output: chunks/chunk_1.fa, chunks/chunk_2.fa, ...
2. buildPartialIndex:
   * For each chunk, creates a partial JSON with fake (mocked) k-mer counts.
   * Output: partial_chunk_1.json, partial_chunk_2.json, ...
3. mergeIndexes:
   * Mocks a merged index file from all partial JSONs.
   * Output: global_index.json

Note: For now, the tool is mocked with echo (not using the Rust binary). The real tool can later replace the mock command with the compiled binary.

##### üìÑ Example (mocked output):
* partial_chunk_1.json

```json
{
  "kmers": {
    "ACGT": 5,
    "CGTG": 3,
    "GTAC": 2
  }
}
```

* global_index.json

```json
{
  "kmers": {
    "ACGT": 10,
    "CGTG": 6,
    "GTAC": 4,
    "TACG": 3
  }
}
```

## 7.4. Advanced Processing for Complex Genomic Scenarios

### experiment_74

Graph-based references, or advanced data structures for dense/sparse variation, often demand specialized software. Rust is increasingly favored because concurrency at this scale can lead to subtle memory corruption in lower-level languages. The snippet below demonstrates a simplified Rust function for merging single-sample VCFs into a preliminary multi-sample VCF, confirming consistent contigs and sample IDs. Though a fully featured multi-sample merge might require coordinate-based matching of variant positions, this example illustrates how concurrency, error handling, and HPC synergy might be organized.
This code memory-maps the file and splits it by newlines in memory, though real-world usage might parse FASTA headers and sequences more intelligently. The concurrency arises naturally when we process lines in parallel with .par_iter(). For HPC usage, ephemeral containers can each map the file, process an assigned slice, and combine partial results in a final stage.

In a production HPC context, ephemeral tasks may each handle a subset of input VCF files, producing intermediate merges. Another ephemeral task merges those partial merges. The code ensures that contigs are consistent, logs warnings for unknown contigs, and uses the Rust type system to enforce error handling. For more advanced tasks like structural variant validation, or merging partial graphs of a DAG-based reference, developers might rely on adjacency lists in memory structures or HPC parallel DFS approaches. Crates such as ndarray could store adjacency matrices for denser subgraphs, while tch-rs might facilitate AI-based classification of structural variants.

Below is a Nextflow pipeline illustrating ephemeral HPC tasks that merge sets of single-sample VCFs and then run a structural variant check on the final result. This ephemeral model is popular when large consortia store many small VCFs representing thousands of samples.

In HPC or cloud infrastructures, ephemeral tasks each handle a chunk of the sample list‚Äîsay, five single-sample VCF files‚Äîand produce partial merges. The final merge merges those partial merges into a single multi-sample VCF. The svCheck step runs an advanced structural variant check on the consolidated result. Each ephemeral container uses a Docker or Singularity image that includes Rust-based binaries (rust_vcf_merge_tool, rust_svcheck_tool). For even larger HPC tasks, developers might chunk the genome itself, analyzing structural variants region by region (Smith et al. (2020)).

#### How to run:

run main.rs in wsl:

```wsl
cargo run -- --reference reference.fasta --region chr1:1-35 --output output.json --threads 4 --verbose | tee output.txt
```

(run main.rs with reference.fasta, region chr:1-35, threads = 4 and verbose as input parameter and output.json as output file and save the output text as output.txt)

run main.nf in wsl:

```wsl
nextflow run main.nf
```

run main.nf with this parameters:
params.reference = 'reference.fasta'
params.region_list = 'regions.txt'
params.output_dir = 'results'
params.threads = Runtime.runtime.availableProcessors()
params.memory = '2.GB'
params.container_version = 'latest'

#### [dependencies]

```toml
anyhow = "1.0"
clap = { version = "4.4", features = ["derive"] }
log = "0.4"
env_logger = "0.11"
memmap2 = "0.9.5"
rayon = "1.8"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

#### Explanation of the Output
##### ‚úÖ main.rs ‚Äì Rust-based Genomic Analyzer
###### üì• Input Parameters
You passed these CLI arguments:

```wsl
--reference reference.fasta 
--region chr1:1-35 
--threads 4 
--verbose
```

###### üîç What it does:
* Memory maps the FASTA file (reference.fasta) using memmap2 for fast access.
* Parses the file and counts GC content (Guanine + Cytosine bases).
* Filters based on optional --region (in your case, "chr1:1-35").
* Computes:
  * GC content
  * Sequence length
* Outputs results in JSON format if --output is specified, and prints log info.

##### üì§ Output Files
* output.json:

```json
{
  "region": "chr1:1-35",
  "gc_content": 0.5142857142857142,
  "sequence_length": 70
}
```

Interpretation: For region chr1:1-35, ~51.4% of the bases are G or C, and the total base count is 70.

* output.txt (stdout/stderr logs):

```text
Processing file: "reference.fasta"
Found 2 sequences in FASTA
Results written to "output.json"
Analysis completed in 37.94141ms
```

##### ‚úÖ main.nf ‚Äì Nextflow Workflow Pipeline
This wraps your tool in a scalable, multi-region pipeline.

###### üßæ What it does step-by-step:
1. Reads config:
   * Input FASTA file
   * List of regions (e.g., chr1:1-35, chr2:1-35)
   * Sets threads, memory, and output directory
2. Creates a dummy tool (dummy_tool.sh) just to simulate output from rust_mmap_tool (for testing).
3. Runs coverage mapping in parallel: For each region:
   * Calls the dummy tool (simulating your real tool)
   * Produces a file: coverage_chr1_1-35.txt, coverage_chr2_1-35.txt
4. Merges coverage outputs:
   * Combines all region files into merged_coverage.txt
   * Computes summary stats in coverage_summary.json via inline Python

###### üì§ Nextflow Output Files
* coverage_chr1_1-35.txt, coverage_chr2_1-35.txt:

```text
chr1:1-35 10
chr1:1-35 15
chr1:1-35 20
```

* merged_coverage.txt:

```text
chr2:1-35 10
chr2:1-35 15
chr2:1-35 20
chr1:1-35 10
chr1:1-35 15

```

* coverage_summary.json:

```json

  "total_regions": 6,
  "min_coverage": 10,
  "max_coverage": 20,
  "mean_coverage": 15,
  "median_coverage": 15.0

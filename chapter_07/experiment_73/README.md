## 7.3. Optimizing Performance and Memory Usage

### experiment_73

An AI engineer might approach large-scale genomic pipelines with an eye to memory mapping, concurrency, and micro-optimization in Rust. The example code below demonstrates how to memory-map a FASTA file using memmap2 and parallelize a line-based operation with rayon, but the same principles can apply to partial coverage analysis or variant queries. The code is ‚Äúproduction ready‚Äù in that it handles file errors robustly and can integrate seamlessly with HPC container environments. For advanced numeric tasks, crates like ndarray can store coverage arrays, linfa might apply machine learning to coverage patterns, and tch-rs can integrate PyTorch if deep neural models are needed. Some developers also incorporate polar for advanced data querying, though care must be taken to manage concurrency with large data sets.

This code memory-maps the file and splits it by newlines in memory, though real-world usage might parse FASTA headers and sequences more intelligently. The concurrency arises naturally when we process lines in parallel with .par_iter(). For HPC usage, ephemeral containers can each map the file, process an assigned slice, and combine partial results in a final stage.

Below is a Nextflow snippet illustrating ephemeral HPC tasks that each process a region with memory mapping. After partial coverage or mismatch statistics are computed, the pipeline merges final outputs. The ephemeral approach ensures that nodes not currently processing data do not idle, saving cost in cloud HPC or local clusters (Di Tommaso et al. (2017)).

The container myrust/memmap_hpc:latest would be built from a Dockerfile containing a statically compiled Rust tool. AI engineers often incorporate cargo flamegraph or Linux perf into the container for on-demand profiling. When scaling to industrial volumes, developers might store coverage counts in a memory-optimized structure, coordinate partial merges with distributed shuffle operations, and handle error checks for misformatted lines or truncated blocks. Tools such as polars can help manage tabular data if advanced queries or joins are needed within the container environment.

#### How to run:

run main.rs in wsl:

```wsl
cargo run -- --reference reference.fasta --region chr1:1-35 --output output.json --threads 4 --verbose | tee output.txt
```

(run main.rs with reference.fasta, region chr:1-35, threads = 4 and verbose as input parameter and output.json as output file and save the output text as output.txt)

run main.nf in wsl:

```wsl
nextflow run main.nf
```

run main.nf with this parameters:
params.reference = 'reference.fasta'
params.region_list = 'regions.txt'
params.output_dir = 'results'
params.threads = Runtime.runtime.availableProcessors()
params.memory = '2.GB'
params.container_version = 'latest'

#### [dependencies]

```toml
anyhow = "1.0"
clap = { version = "4.4", features = ["derive"] }
log = "0.4"
env_logger = "0.11"
memmap2 = "0.9.5"
rayon = "1.8"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

#### Explanation of the Output
##### üîç Main Output Explanation
###### ü¶Ä main.rs (Rust CLI Tool)
This tool builds a global k-mer frequency index from a reference DNA sequence.

##### ‚úÖ Key Steps and Output:
1. Reads reference.fa:
   * Contains DNA sequences.
2. Splits into overlapping chunks (in memory):
   * Each chunk of size 1,000,000 bp with overlap of k-1 = 30 bp to ensure k-mers are not split across boundaries.
3. Generates partial indexes in parallel:
   * Using Rayon threads, k-mers (length 31) are extracted and counted per chunk.
4. Merges partial indexes:
   * Final global map is written as global_index.json.

##### ‚úÖ Output:
* global_index.json: JSON object mapping each valid k-mer to its total count across the whole sequence.

###### üìÑ Example (simplified):
```text
{
  "ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACG": 7,
  "GTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTA": 6,
  ...
}
```

##### üöÄ main.nf (Nextflow Workflow)
This orchestrates the full pipeline ‚Äî chunking, indexing, and merging ‚Äî using the same logic.

###### ‚úÖ Processes:
1. chunkReference:
   * Uses awk to split the FASTA file into chunks with overlap.
   * Output: chunks/chunk_1.fa, chunks/chunk_2.fa, ...
2. buildPartialIndex:
   * For each chunk, creates a partial JSON with fake (mocked) k-mer counts.
   * Output: partial_chunk_1.json, partial_chunk_2.json, ...
3. mergeIndexes:
   * Mocks a merged index file from all partial JSONs.
   * Output: global_index.json

Note: For now, the tool is mocked with echo (not using the Rust binary). The real tool can later replace the mock command with the compiled binary.

##### üìÑ Example (mocked output):
* partial_chunk_1.json

```json
{
  "kmers": {
    "ACGT": 5,
    "CGTG": 3,
    "GTAC": 2
  }
}
```

* global_index.json

```json
{
  "kmers": {
    "ACGT": 10,
    "CGTG": 6,
    "GTAC": 4,
    "TACG": 3
  }
}
```

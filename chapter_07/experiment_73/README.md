## 7.3. Optimizing Performance and Memory Usage

### experiment_73

An AI engineer might approach large-scale genomic pipelines with an eye to memory mapping, concurrency, and micro-optimization in Rust. The example code below demonstrates how to memory-map a FASTA file using memmap2 and parallelize a line-based operation with rayon, but the same principles can apply to partial coverage analysis or variant queries. The code is ‚Äúproduction ready‚Äù in that it handles file errors robustly and can integrate seamlessly with HPC container environments. For advanced numeric tasks, crates like ndarray can store coverage arrays, linfa might apply machine learning to coverage patterns, and tch-rs can integrate PyTorch if deep neural models are needed. Some developers also incorporate polar for advanced data querying, though care must be taken to manage concurrency with large data sets.

This code memory-maps the file and splits it by newlines in memory, though real-world usage might parse FASTA headers and sequences more intelligently. The concurrency arises naturally when we process lines in parallel with .par_iter(). For HPC usage, ephemeral containers can each map the file, process an assigned slice, and combine partial results in a final stage.

Below is a Nextflow snippet illustrating ephemeral HPC tasks that each process a region with memory mapping. After partial coverage or mismatch statistics are computed, the pipeline merges final outputs. The ephemeral approach ensures that nodes not currently processing data do not idle, saving cost in cloud HPC or local clusters (Di Tommaso et al. (2017)).

The container myrust/memmap_hpc:latest would be built from a Dockerfile containing a statically compiled Rust tool. AI engineers often incorporate cargo flamegraph or Linux perf into the container for on-demand profiling. When scaling to industrial volumes, developers might store coverage counts in a memory-optimized structure, coordinate partial merges with distributed shuffle operations, and handle error checks for misformatted lines or truncated blocks. Tools such as polars can help manage tabular data if advanced queries or joins are needed within the container environment.

#### How to run:

run main.rs in wsl:

```wsl
cargo run -- --reference reference.fasta --region chr1:1-35 --output output.json --threads 4 --verbose | tee output.txt
```

(run main.rs with reference.fasta, region chr:1-35, threads = 4 and verbose as input parameter and output.json as output file and save the output text as output.txt)

run main.nf in wsl:

```wsl
nextflow run main.nf
```

run main.nf with this parameters:
params.reference = 'reference.fasta'
params.region_list = 'regions.txt'
params.output_dir = 'results'
params.threads = Runtime.runtime.availableProcessors()
params.memory = '2.GB'
params.container_version = 'latest'

#### [dependencies]

```toml
anyhow = "1.0"
clap = { version = "4.4", features = ["derive"] }
log = "0.4"
env_logger = "0.11"
memmap2 = "0.9.5"
rayon = "1.8"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

#### Explanation of the Output
##### ‚úÖ main.rs ‚Äì Rust-based Genomic Analyzer
###### üì• Input Parameters
You passed these CLI arguments:

```wsl
--reference reference.fasta 
--region chr1:1-35 
--threads 4 
--verbose
```

###### üîç What it does:
* Memory maps the FASTA file (reference.fasta) using memmap2 for fast access.
* Parses the file and counts GC content (Guanine + Cytosine bases).
* Filters based on optional --region (in your case, "chr1:1-35").
* Computes:
  * GC content
  * Sequence length
* Outputs results in JSON format if --output is specified, and prints log info.

##### üì§ Output Files
* output.json:

```json
{
  "region": "chr1:1-35",
  "gc_content": 0.5142857142857142,
  "sequence_length": 70
}
```

Interpretation: For region chr1:1-35, ~51.4% of the bases are G or C, and the total base count is 70.

* output.txt (stdout/stderr logs):

```text
Processing file: "reference.fasta"
Found 2 sequences in FASTA
Results written to "output.json"
Analysis completed in 37.94141ms
```

##### ‚úÖ main.nf ‚Äì Nextflow Workflow Pipeline
This wraps your tool in a scalable, multi-region pipeline.

###### üßæ What it does step-by-step:
1. Reads config:
   * Input FASTA file
   * List of regions (e.g., chr1:1-35, chr2:1-35)
   * Sets threads, memory, and output directory
2. Creates a dummy tool (dummy_tool.sh) just to simulate output from rust_mmap_tool (for testing).
3. Runs coverage mapping in parallel: For each region:
   * Calls the dummy tool (simulating your real tool)
   * Produces a file: coverage_chr1_1-35.txt, coverage_chr2_1-35.txt
4. Merges coverage outputs:
   * Combines all region files into merged_coverage.txt
   * Computes summary stats in coverage_summary.json via inline Python

###### üì§ Nextflow Output Files
* coverage_chr1_1-35.txt, coverage_chr2_1-35.txt:

```text
chr1:1-35 10
chr1:1-35 15
chr1:1-35 20
```

* merged_coverage.txt:

```text
chr2:1-35 10
chr2:1-35 15
chr2:1-35 20
chr1:1-35 10
chr1:1-35 15
chr1:1-35 20
```

* coverage_summary.json:

```json
{
  "total_regions": 6,
  "min_coverage": 10,
  "max_coverage": 20,
  "mean_coverage": 15,
  "median_coverage": 15.0
}
```

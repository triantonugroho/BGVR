# 7. Advanced Genomic Data Parsing with Noodles

## 7.1. Foundational Data Structures in Rust Noodles

### experiment_71
Rust code highlights Rust integration using noodles-bam and noodles-vcf for coverage calculations and variant reading. This code is structured for HPC concurrency, streaming partial results from multiple intervals.

The Nextflow pipeline shown below orchestrates ephemeral container tasks that each invoke Rust binaries compiled from the above rust code.

## 7.2. Advanced Algorithms for High-Throughput Genomic Data

### experiment_72
Rust program written in an AI engineer style, shows a simplified Rust program that simulates partial suffix array or k-mer index construction for large references.

Nextflow script that demonstrates how ephemeral container tasks are orchestrated in practice. It chunks a reference file, runs the Rust-based index construction on each chunk, then merges partial outputs.

## 7.3. Optimizing Performance and Memory Usage

### experiment_73
Rust code demonstrates how to memory-map a FASTA file using memmap2 and parallelize a line-based operation with rayon, but the same principles can apply to partial coverage analysis or variant queries

Nextflow snippet illustrating ephemeral HPC tasks that each process a region with memory mapping.

## 7.4. Advanced Processing for Complex Genomic Scenarios

### experiment_74
Rust code emonstrates a simplified Rust function for merging single-sample VCFs into a preliminary multi-sample VCF, confirming consistent contigs and sample IDs.

Nextflow pipeline illustrating ephemeral HPC tasks that merge sets of single-sample VCFs and then run a structural variant check on the final result.

## 7.5. Integrating Rust Noodles into Nextflow Pipelines

### experiment_75
Rust code example demonstrates how to open and index a BAM file if necessary, calculate base‐by‐base coverage over a specific genomic region using the noodles-bam and noodles-core crates, and finally serialize the results to JSON via serde.

Nextflow script demonstrating how to run the previously described Rust coverage tool inside ephemeral containers on multiple BAM inputs, with each coverage task executed in parallel and a final step merging the JSON outputs.
